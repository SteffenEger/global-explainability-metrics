MEPs of Welsh origin worry about "looking like idiots"
The proposal to change the name of the assembly to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) stunned some of its members.
The main reason for this was plans to rename the National Assembly the 'Welsh Parliament'.
Members of all parties belonging to the National Assembly fear that they will be mocked for this.
A Labor MP said this rhymed with "Twp and Pwp".
In Welsh, “twp” means “stupid, stupid”, “pwp” means “poop”.
According to a member of the Plaid Cymru assembly, the group was “not satisfied” overall and had suggested further options.
According to a Welsh Conservative, his group would welcome a name change, but he drew attention to the fact that "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament) is verbally not too far from "Muppet".
Note: In Welsh, the letter W is pronounced similarly to the U in English.
According to the current elaboration of a draft law that should regulate the change of names, the committee of the people's representative body, the final decision on the form of address for participants in the National Assembly lies with the participants themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the option to change its name.
The committee announced last June that the public hearing had welcomed the proposed change of name in the Welsh Parliament.
When asked what title Members of Parliament from Wales should have, the majority of the Commission voted "WMPs" themselves, but in a public poll, "MWPs" was the favorite.
A difficult endeavor for Chair Elin JONES, who is being called for a bill on these adjustments within a few weeks, is likely to be to reach an agreement, even if Welsh MPs seem to suggest possible alternatives.
The legislative provisions governing reforms will include changes in the way the Assembly works. These include u. a. Rules on disqualifying members of the Welsh Parliament and shaping the committee system.
When discussing the law, the members of the National Assembly have the opportunity to define their own name.
In Macedonia, a referendum is being held on a possible change of the country's name.
The vote on the official renaming of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia" will take place on Sunday.
The referendum serves to settle a dispute that has been simmering for several decades with neighboring Greece, where a province is also referred to as Macedonia.
The Greek government has already repeatedly objected to the EU and NATO applications for membership of the northern neighboring country, not least because the name of Athens expresses a claim to its own territory in the eyes of Athens.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia and against the referendum on the name change, has said that he will not heed the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, pragmatically view the renaming as the price to pay for membership in the EU and NATO.
The troubles faced by the churches in Harlem have caused the bells of St. Martin to stop ringing
"Older people I've spoken to said that there used to be a bar and church on every corner," said Adams.
"Neither-nor is not an option today."
He can understand that bars are disappearing.
“In today's world, people bond in a different way,” he said.
"Bars have become obsolete as usual meeting places that were like a parlor in the vicinity."
With regard to the churches, he fears that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders believe.
In the place of churches, multi-family houses with condominiums could move - condominiums for those people who are of no help to the other places of refuge in the district.
He said it would be almost entirely white people who purchase condominiums in these buildings. "As a result, the day on which these churches must be finally closed is fast approaching. It can be assumed that most of these people who move into the condominiums will not become members of these churches."
It was white congregations that had built both churches before Harlem became a black metropolis in 1970 - Metropolitan Community, ten years later St. Martin's.
In the 1930s, the once white Methodist community left the place.
The building was acquired by a local black religious community.
A black congregation took over, led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who also saw to it that shops on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, that refused to give black jobs or support them were boycotted St. Martin.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939. When Father Johnson's parishioners were working out plans to rebuild the building, they also commissioned the chimes.
Father David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson of St. Martin's Church, proudly calls the chimes “the bells of the poor”.
The glockenspiel professional who played the instrument in July also described it as a “cultural treasure” and a “unique historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, recognized that it was the world's first carillon to be played by a black musician - Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years earlier , also.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has not replaced him.
The events of the past few months at St. Martin are characterized by complicated connections to architects and construction companies, which were brought in partly by the lay leaders of the church and partly by the bishops of the diocese.
The concern of the sacristy (the leadership of the parish, consisting of lay people), which this also expressed in its letter to the diocese in July, was that the diocese “try to impose costs on the sacristy”, the sacristy in commissioning Architects and other service providers of the diocese played no role.
Some members of the parish have complained that the diocese is insufficiently transparent.
13-year-old boy scuba diving for lobsters in California, victims of a shark
Officials said that on Saturday, the opening day of lobster season, a 13-year-old was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for lobsters.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he heard the boy's screaming on Saturday morning during a 30-minute dive with friends, after which they paddled to him to get him out of the water.
"At first I thought someone was thrilled to have caught a lobster," said Hammel. “But then I realized that someone was screaming, that they were being bitten”.
I was the victim of a bite!
As he approached the boy, Mutton saw that his entire collarbone was exposed.
Hammel remarked: "To get everyone out of the water, I shouted:" There's a shark swimming there! "
The boy was admitted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was classified as critical.
The species of shark from which the attack originated is not yet known.
At a press conference, lifeguard Larry Giles stated that a shark had appeared in the area a few weeks ago. However, it has been proven that this species of shark is harmless.
Giles inflicted further traumatic wounds on the upper body of the victim.
For security reasons, access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami‘s in Ecinitas was blocked by officials for 48 hours.
Giles found that the area is home to more than 135 species of shark. However, the majority do not pose a threat to humans.
Sainsbury wants to enter the UK beauty products market.
Sainsbury‘s buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams. In the future, cosmetic products will be presented here on shelves with a department store atmosphere and expert employees.
In the context of a major foray into the UK beauty products market, which is still growing and valued at £ 2.8 billion, sales of fashion and home goods will continue to decline. Test runs were carried out in the country's 11 largest branches in order to boost sales again a little next year.
The newly created space on the shelf, which was previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household goods, is now being filled differently by supermarkets. And so the idea came to invest more in the cosmetics industry.
Sainsbury's said it will double the product range from beauty products to 3000 products. For the first time, the range would also be expanded to include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw can be expanded.
More space is also to be created for brands such as L‘Oreal, Maybelline and Burt‘s Bees, whose products are already in stock, so that presentations similar to boots and other shops will be possible.
The in-house cosmetics brand of the supermarket chain, “Boutique”, was also revitalized. This is particularly popular with young customers for its range of vegan items.
Last week, the first of two Sainsbury's opened in Croydon, South London, where fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop is planning to conduct trial runs for concessions; the second store opens towards the end of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend to get daily groceries in small neighborhood stores are causing supermarkets to do more to get people to come to them.
The supermarket chain wants to stand out from the competition from the discounter sector, such as Aldi and Lidl, through more service and non-food products. Therefore, the branches should increasingly get the look of department stores, says Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe.
Since the purchase of the two retail chains two years earlier, Sainsbury's have set up Argos outlets in several hundred branches and inaugurated several Habitats, which apparently has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
In the past, the supermarket has not been particularly successful in redesigning its cosmetics and pharmacy areas.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury‘s tested a joint venture with Boots. However, this ended with no clear result and the pharmacies' income could not be divided.
After Sainsbury‘s had sold its 281 pharmacy branches three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, a new strategy is now to be pursued.
Allegedly, Lloyd is among those involved, because the range of luxury and main care products from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is to be expanded considerably in four Lloyd stores.
"In the interest of better equipment for our customers, we have fundamentally redesigned the appearance of the shelves with our beauty products," says Paul Mills-Hicks, head of the advertising department at Sainsbury‘s.
Our other investments include training employees to give consumers the information they need to make decisions.
Our brand profile leaves nothing to be desired. Thanks to our elegant atmosphere, convenient downtown location and advanced shopping experience, we are a popular destination as beauty experts.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby turns down the £ 11 million deal.
Peter Jones, known from Dragons Den, made an angry exit after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from his lifestyle brand's £ 11 million deal. For Willoughby, her new commitments to Marks and Spencers and ITV are now paramount.
Willoughby lacks the time for her homewear and accessories brand, Truly.
The pair's business had previously been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The This Morning presenter announced her resignation on Instagram.
Because she wanted to focus on her own high-value contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, Holly Willoughby got out of the lucrative lifestyle brand she owned and left with Dragons' Den celebrity Peter Jones shortly before the deadline this angry back.
Sources said Jones was upset when the television gold girl admitted at a tense conference on Tuesday at the heart of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she was running out of time on her approximately £ 1.5 million worth of new contracts Homewear and accessories brand Truly will have.
After comparing the deal with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, it is clear that Willoughby's net worth would double of approximately £ 11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones from the UK made his way to one of his vacation homes.
Indeed, according to a source, that was one of Holly's top priorities.
As was intended to serve as their long-term protection for the future and was designed for several decades.
Everyone involved was appalled when she decided to resign.
For most of them, this event on Tuesday - so shortly before it was supposed to start - was simply incredible.
"A depot filled with salable products is located near Marlow HQ."
Because of the high investment in merchandising items, e.g. B. pillows, candles, clothing and homewear, as well as a certain likelihood that the market launch will be postponed even further, experts believe that the company can by the departure of the presenter of "This Morning", one of the most profitable celebrities in the UK , Lose millions.
It could also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been friends with Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin for a decade.
Truly was founded in 2016 by Willoughby and Capp. Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is planned as the brand ambassador for Marks & Spencer and is to replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of "I‘m A Celebrity" on ITV.
"We are not expected to comment on his business activities," revealed an informant from Jones ‘area yesterday evening.
First we spoke plainly, then we fell in love.
He was reprimanded by the news media for his positive assessment of the head of state of North Korea and his remark, which some people perceived as “unprivileged,” which he made fun of.
What made President Trump compromise so many?
Trump stated this in his sneering “news anchor” voice.
"I have not made any compromises".
After hailing the first meeting with Kim in Singapore in June as an important step forward in the denuclearization of North Korea, Trump noted that Kim was interested in a second conversation.
There is a standstill in the talks about denuclearization.
Ri Yong Ho, the leading diplomat from North Korea, spoke to UN politicians at the General Assembly on Saturday over three months after the Singapore summit in June, saying that the North could not implement an "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's recognize first disarmament measures.
He said the US is instead maintaining sanctions to keep pressure.
In his speech at the manifestation, Trump was much more confident.
"We are making great strides with North Korea," he said.
“We intended to wage war against North Korea.
It would have meant the deaths of millions of people.
We now have this fantastic relationship. "
According to him, his efforts to improve the situation with Kim have produced positive results, including the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the repatriation of the remains of American soldiers.
When telling about his connections with Kim, he justified his conspicuous actions.
Pointing at the people in front of him, Trump said, “It's easy to look like a president, but instead of the 10,000 people waiting in front of the crowded stadium to be allowed in, only around 200 people would be standing there . "
Hundreds of dead and a demolished island in the tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
In order for international aid organizations to be called into action, a declaration of the national disaster emergency should have taken place. This did not happen, although over 10% of the population of Lombok had been relocated.
Sumbung said: "Unfortunately, in many cases they have clearly refused foreign aid, so there are now some difficulties."
Save the Children is preparing a group to travel to Palu, but it is still uncertain whether foreigners can work there.
According to the spokesman for the national civil protection agency, Mr Sutopo, officials in Indonesia are currently evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether it would be possible to involve international organizations in the relief efforts.
Unfortunately, Indonesia is still not well prepared for natural disasters, although Indonesia is frequently exposed to earthquakes.
While shelters against tsunamis were being built in Aceh. This is not normal on other parts of the coast.
Even if the warning of a tsunami had already been issued, part of the guilt that people died was due to the fact that there was no tsunami warning siren in Palu.
Getting around between the numerous Indonesian islands is difficult even when all conditions are favorable.
Natural disasters make the demands on logistics even more demanding.
The hospital ship that had previously docked in Lombok to provide medical care for the earthquake victims is already expected in Palu. However, it can take three days or more until it arrives at the new disaster site.
The improvement of the desolate infrastructure is at the center of the election campaign of President Joko Widodo, who has already invested considerable sums in the country's road and rail network.
And with re-election next year, Mr. Joko and his administration are concerned about funding shortfalls.
Joko is also under pressure from ongoing religious conflict in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority are turning more and more to a more conservative interpretation of Islam.
The clash between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other old-fashioned weapons, left over 1,000 people dead and tens of thousands vacated.

Thanks to a goal from Belgium professional Eden Hazard in the 25th minute, Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at halftime.

The statue of Cromwell in front of Parliament is the latest in the history of "rewriting"
In response to the Taliban-style devastation of such a large number of English works created by man in the fields of culture and religion, his expulsion would be a powerful expression of justice.
However, the Cromwell Society dismissed Mr. Crick's advance as "stupidity". Rather, she sees this as an "attempt to rewrite history".
"Given the current discussions about the removal of monuments, it was only a matter of time before the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of Westminster Palace began to attract attention," said Cromwell Society Chairman John Goldsmith.
Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
It is also possible that the fake Cromwell was sacrificed for the crimes of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
The extremely positive portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is an expression of a historical image that dominated the 19th century and that is still widespread among some historians, namely that Cromwell is a personality who should be celebrated.
Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr. Goldsmith said: “Many, if more towards the end of the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell an advocate of Parliament who resisted external pressure; in his case, of course, that of the monarchy.
The further course of this historical discussion will show whether everything was correctly reproduced.
What is certain is that this conflict in the middle of the 17th century had a strong influence on the subsequent development of our country - Cromwell is one side of the coin that stands out as an individual.
One should also remember his successes as Lord Protector and celebrate them. "
Chinese farmer torn by pig
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the body of a male victim identified as "Yuxan" was found at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou County. The victim was covered with blood, a wrists pierced.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he and his cousin went to the market from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs.
His cousin, who found the body the next morning, noticed that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
According to him, there is a large boar in the stable with blood on its mouth.
A forensic report revealed that the farmer was killed by the pig weighing around 250 kg.
In an interview with the Guiyan Evening News, my cousin Wu commented: "My cousin had bloody and battered legs",
The surveillance camera footage shows that Yuan went to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
An hour later he was found dead.
The owner of the animal responsible for the death of the man is neither Yuan nor his cousin.
In order to avoid further attacks during the police investigation at the scene, the pig was temporarily locked away, a market administrator told the Evening News.
It is reported that Yuan's family is negotiating compensation for his death with the market authorities.
There have been reports of pigs attacking people before, even if that rarely happens.
In 2016, a couple were attacked by a pig on their Massachusetts farm, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a farmer from Wales was held onto his tractor by a 650 pound pig before his wife could chase the animal away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs, after which a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are typically not malicious, but that the taste of blood can induce aggressive behavior.
“You are especially childlike.
They act like toddlers and show a lot of curiosity ... it is not their intention to hurt anyone.
He said that they just needed to be given the necessary respect.
In the wake of Hurricane Rosa, heavy rainfall occurs over a large area in the southwestern United States.
According to the forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakened as the storm moved towards the cooler waters of Mexico's north coast.
In northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, pink will cause precipitation with flooding in the coming days.
As of 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, Eastern Time, Rosa had a wind speed of 137 km / h - this corresponds to a category 1 hurricane. At that time, the storm was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
In all likelihood, Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a barrel is forming over the Pacific that migrates east to the west coast of the USA. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin pushing heavy tropical moisture north and into the southwestern United States.
In Mexico, due to pink, rain of up to 10 cm is to be expected on Monday.
Over the next few days, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching low, causing widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm of rain in the desert can lead to dangerous floods, scree flows and landslides.
Especially in southern Nevada and various regions of Arizona, the high tropical humidity leads to precipitation amounts of 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in some areas.
In particular over a large part of Arizona, but also in other areas of the southwest, 5 to 10 cm of rain should fall.
Since there are several rainforests in the tropics, flooding can occur quickly.
Due to the risk of tropical rainfalls, people are strongly warned against hiking trips in the desert.
Storms could result in local gusts of wind and dust swirls, and large amounts of precipitation could turn ravines into torrential torrents.
For a part of the coast of Southern California, the approaching low is supposed to cause heavy precipitation locally.
Precipitation amounts of over 1.3 cm are conceivable. This could result in slight landslides and slippery road conditions.
With this precipitation, the wet season in the region is heralded.
On Sunday evening and early Monday morning, some scattered tropical rainfall will be approaching the state of Arizona. Then the rain will move on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains can be expected to spread in all directions between Tuesday and Wednesday.
With the Arctic cooling off and the tropics remaining at high temperatures, large temperature fluctuations are possible across the United States in October.
Every now and then, this can create strong temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there were extremely large temperature differences in the central regions of the USA.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is just under 20 degrees.
The coming days will be characterized by summer warmth, which can become even more intense and spread.
October is expected to start warm, with temperatures of 26 degrees almost everywhere from the Southern Plains to partly in the northeast of the country, according to expectations in large parts of the central and eastern United States.
In New York it could be 80 degrees Fahrenheit next Tuesday, 10 degrees more than the average.
Our weather forecast for a longer period assumes good chances for the average temperatures in the east of the USA in the first two weeks of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's survey was seen by more than 20 million viewers
On Thursday, over 20 million people on six television networks watched statements by Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s.
Changes to the apparently hopeless political situation were meanwhile not in sight. On Friday, the regular television program was interrupted by an unforeseen breaking news: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona had drafted an agreement that the FBI would be given a week to investigate the allegations.
Speaking to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford said she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her while drunk and tried to pull her clothes off after a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in his flaming testimony that the allegations were absolutely untrue.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched on Friday.
The company tracked average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, the Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures for the other networks that broadcast the survey, including a. PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
Nielsen usually struggles with recording people watching in office spaces.
The number of visitors is roughly the same as at a football game in the playoffs or at the Academy Awards, to put that in perspective.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators clearly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was ahead of all other channels during the all-day hearing with 5.69 million viewers.
With 3.26 million, ABC was in second place in the audience ranking.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.80 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
There was also great interest after the hearing.
Friday's drama was all about Flake.
The moderate Republican was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS after he announced through his office that he would vote for Kavanaugh. On the video recordings, he is cursed by demonstrators while trying to enter an elevator on the way to the courtroom.
He endured the insults for several minutes, looking down. CNN broadcast the whole event live.
"I am right in front of your eyes," commented one woman.
"Do you think he's honest with the country?"
"Most women are helpless, but you have the strength," he was told.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and shortly before the elevator doors closed, he said he would explain more at the committee hearing.
The judicial committee vote was later broadcast live on television and radio. This should probably speed up the voting process in the assembled Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh.
However, Flake stated that he would only do so if the charges against the nominee were reviewed by the FBI within the next week, which many Democrats, who are in the minority, have been pushing for some time.
Senator Chris Coons of the Democrats was able to partially get his friend Flake on his side in talks.
Flake made his decision after speaking to Coons and a number of other Senate members.
Flake's election was telling because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
The allegations made against Kavanaugh are to be investigated as part of an investigation initiated by President Trump.
The British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for the purpose of “political games”.
"You are playing political games with the UK's prospects for the years to come and endanger national affairs," is the charge made by Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times against those who criticized her plans for leaving the EU.
Prime Minister Theresa May will be present at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29.09.2018.
Her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Checkers plan for Brexit in an interview that appeared on the front page of the newspaper next to her interview. He thinks the idea that the UK and the EU should each collect the other side's tariffs is "completely absurd".
Shots at Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the case of the murdered LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested for manslaughter and sent to prison.
The altercation between Sims and Simpson was made public by police officers. According to police, Sims' glasses fell off during the confrontation.
CBS reported, based on the WAFB reports, that police had identified Simpson's DNA on the glasses found at the scene.
Simpson admitted to having killed Wayde with a gun, the police said after the interrogation.
According to the attorney, his debt is $ 350,000.
East Baton Rouge Parish coroner announced in an initial report on Friday that the victim was killed from a gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and residents were thanked for their help in the investigation into the arrest.
Joe Alleva, sports director of LSU, thanked the investigating authorities for having worked hard and eager to bring about justice.
Sims reached the age of 20.
His father Wayne was a member of the LSU basketball team in Baton Rouge, where the 1.98-meter-tall attacker spent his youth.
On average, he achieved 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach, said Friday morning that the team was "completely shaken" and "in shock" by the murder of Wayde.
Wade remarked, "This is exactly what you worry about all the time."
It is raining volcanic ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano are now laying over the boroughs in the south of the Mexican capital.
After crater activity and 183 gas and ash emissions have been recorded in the past 24 hours, the Mexican Center for Disaster Prevention issued a warning on Saturday against approaching the volcano.
The center observed numerous tremors.
In photos taken in the districts of Mexico City, etc. a. in Xochimilco, recorded and published on social networks, you can see cars whose windshields are covered with a fine layer of ash.
After a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists said there was increased activity in the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of independence, there were clashes between police officers and Catalan separatists.
In Barcelona on Saturday, on the first anniversary of the referendum on Catalan independence, pro-independence demonstrators clashed with riot police. Six people were arrested. The referendum polarized the region. Thousands demonstrated on the other side.
The riot police were able to stop a group of masked separatists who attacked the police with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are otherwise popular with tourists.
In the course of the day there were brawls with the police, who were equipped with batons to stop the tumult.
Pro-independence movements repeated their mantra for hours: "We do not forget, we do not forgive." On the other side, protesters from the trade unions stood shouting: "Long live Spain."
According to local newspapers, 14 people received treatment for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations.
After the referendum on October 1st, the situation remains tense. Madrid had ruled the referendum illegal, but the separatist Catalans are still celebrating it.
The decision in favor of an independent election was clear from the electorate, even though only a few participants had voted for a division.
Catalan authorities say almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote. Violent clashes broke out at a number of polling stations in the area.
Independence activist groups camped outdoors on Friday to prevent a demonstration by supporters of the national police.
Even if the route had to be changed, the protest continued.
Now he is no longer optimistic about an independent Catalonia, explains Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was part of the demonstrations for independence with his wife.
“Last year we had one of our top moments.
He said that he had seen his parents shed tears for the joy of being allowed to vote, but that they were all now helpless.
Although the Catalan independence parties won a decisive, if narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, this year they have struggled to stay in either self-imposed exile or imprisonment with many of their most prominent leaders on their roles the organization of the referendum and the process await a subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his cellphone said politicians on both sides had fueled the conflict.
He said: “The situation is getting worse and worse”.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine leaders of the Catalan independence movement who has been in custody since the end of last year, said on Saturday that he will be available for next year's European Parliament elections.
He stated that the best way to protest against the decline of democratic principles and the backward trend of the Spanish government would be to run for election in the European elections.
Londonderry: Males were taken into custody after a vehicle crashed into the house.
A car attacked a house in Londonderry several times. A 33-year-old, a 34-year-old and a 39-year-old were arrested.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent around 7:30 p.m. UK daylight saving time.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the entrance gate and the house.
The vehicle was likely fired with a crossbow.
Thanks to a shot from Menga, Livingston defeated the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston led to victory
Livingston caused a surprising defeat for the Rangers - the second in 18 games with Steven Gerrard coaching the Ibrox side.
It was thanks to Dolly Menga's goal that Gary Holt's team moved up to second behind Hibernian.
So far, Gerrard's team has not won away games in the Premiership. Next Sunday there is a game against the first-placed Hearts, who is currently eight points ahead.
On Thursday, the Rangers welcomed their guests from Rapid Vienna to the Europa League.
Livingston can now record six games without defeat in a row in his division. The same cannot be said of head coach Holt, who took a win to replace Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston gambled away chances despite unfocused opponents
Since they put the Rangers under considerable pressure with their direct game, Holts players should have taken the lead long ago.
Scott Robinson broke through with the ball but missed over the gate. Alan Ligthgow was only able to divert his strength after he had put Craig Halkett's header over the goal.
The hosts agreed that the Rangers game should take place first, knowing that the visitors could be disturbed in set pieces.
And that is how the decisive goal came about.
By opening the game after a free kick caused by the Rangers, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were staged together against Menga, who came into the penalty area with a handball and marked a goal there.
The insurmountable defense of the home team ensured that their goalkeeper Liam Kelly had a quiet evening despite the high proportion of possession of the Rangers during this phase.
This pattern could be seen until the second half, even when Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the ball.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's shot. Another Livingston standard situation led to the extension of play for Lithgow.
In Livingston's penalty area there were numerous crosses that could be blocked. The demand for two penalties - once because of Halkett's foul on substitute Glenn Middleton and once for handball - was not granted.
Incredibles from Livingston - an analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland visits the Tony Macaroni Arena
For Livingston an excellent performance and a sensational record.
They were all very good and consistently exceeded all expectations in this upward trend.
Under Holt, the style of play and the staff have practically remained the same after returning to the top league, but he is very much appreciated for how much he has motivated the team since starting work.
He had so many role models.
Thanks to Captain Halkett, the defense was well organized. Meanwhile Menga stood in the way of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers didn't seem particularly creative.
They no longer had the level they sometimes had under Gerrard.
The team's last ball disappointed - the home team was only cut open once - and one could speak of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the table.
Erdogan's visit to Cologne causes mixed feelings
The atmosphere and the weather were good on Saturday (September 29) at the meeting in Berlin between the head of Turkey and the German Chancellor.
President Erdogan's final day of his much-discussed trip to Germany, which is intended to restore relations between the NATO allies, lies ahead of him.
Opinions differed on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan's next stop was Cologne, where he opened a gigantic new mosque.
Outside Turkey, this is the city with the highest number of Turkish residents.
The police cited security concerns as the reason they prevented the crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque. But many came close anyway to take a look at their president.
Erdogan's policy, as well as the decision by the German government to receive him in the country, was criticized by several hundred participants - including many Kurds - in a rally against Erdogan, who ensured that they could be heard.
The protests show how divided a visitor is, whom some German Turks celebrate as heroes and others sharply criticize as sole rulers.
Accident on Deptford Road: cyclist collides with a car and dies
In London, a cyclist died in a car accident.
The accident occurred around 10:15 am BST near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street in Deptford, which is in the southeast of the city. It is a street with heavy traffic.
The man died at the scene of the accident after the driver of the car stopped and the emergency services arrived.
It's been just two months since another cyclist was killed in a hit and miss accident on Childers Street - just a mile or so from where it happened on Saturday.
An identification of the man and the subsequent notification of his next of kin by the London police is currently in progress, according to the company.
Roads were closed and buses diverted. The recommendation was to drive a wide berth around the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in riot
According to the prison, six officers were injured in a riot in a maximum security prison for men.
The riot began at 9:30 a.m. UK daylight saving time at Long Lartin Royal Prison in Worcestershire and is still going on.
Eight inmates, who are in the same wing, participated in the uprising, which specially trained "Tornado" police officers were sent to break up.
The officers were treated locally for minor facial injuries.
According to a representative of the prison service, the detention center's special forces were sent to work in the HMP Long Lartin prison because of ongoing unrest.
Six employees had to receive medical attention due to their injuries.
Violence has no place in our prisons and we can assure you that those responsible will be handed over to the police and have to serve longer sentences. "
HMP Long Lartin prison is serving over 500 offenders, including many of the most dangerous in the country.
The prison director reportedly had to be hospitalized in June after being attacked by an inmate.
Last October, the riot police went to the prison to deal with a situation where staff were victims of attacks with pool balls.
Flash floods from Hurricane Pink threaten in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought areas could have an advantage)
The last strong foothills from tropical cyclone Rosa hit the desert in the southwest and possibly cause sudden flooding - Arizona will be hit by a tropical depression as early as the beginning of next week, which usually rarely happens.
For the west of Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, in the southeast of California and Utah, including the places Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, the National Weather Service issued measuring instruments for flash floods for Monday and Tuesday.
Presumably, Rosa will move over Phoenix by the shortest route on Tuesday and bring rain with it on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that the status of tropical storms or cyclones has only been maintained in ten tropical cyclones within a radius of 200 miles around Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina was a hurricane in 1967 that moved 40 miles across the Arizona border.
The forecasts based on the latest models from the National Hurricane Center assume 2 to 4 inches of precipitation, in isolated cases up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other parts of the Desert Southwest, u. a. the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 cm is to be expected, in individual cases up to 10 cm.
Where pink means no danger of flooding, the rainfall can be a real gift as the area has suffered severe drought.
As there are currently periods of great drought in the southwest, these rains, even if flooding per se is something of great concern, will probably be partially useful.
According to the US Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, ”according to weather.com
Hurricane Rosa will first hit land over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had hurricane strength with maximum wind speeds of 136 km / h. The storm is currently 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 19 km / h.
In the Pacific, the storm is hitting colder water, which should mitigate it.
It can be assumed that pink will hit mainland Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
Occasionally, there could be heavy rainfall in Mexico, which entails a great risk of flooding.
From Baja California to Sonora in the northwest, rainfalls of 7 to 15 cm can be expected, sometimes up to 25 cm, ”says weather.com.
Mexico will experience Rosa as a tropical storm on its way north, after which it will turn into a tropical low on the Arizona border early Tuesday morning and move through Arizona and southern Utah until late at night.
“According to the National Hurricane Center, the most dangerous expected consequences of Hurricane Rosa include heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southern west coast of the USA.
Possible consequences of the rains could be life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in desert areas as well as landslides in the mountains.
Four people are arrested in Midsomer Norton after an attempted murder
After a 16-year-old was stabbed in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested. They are charged with attempted murder.
The kid was found near Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at 4:00 a.m. BST on Saturday.
He was admitted to the hospital and the condition remained “unchanged”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area that night, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police asked anyone who might have cell phone recordings of the incident to report to her.
Trump described Kavanaugh as a victim of democratic anger and meanness.
At a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump said that "one vote for Judge Kavanaugh is one vote against the unscrupulous and outrageous intrigues of the Democrats".
According to Trump, Kavanaugh suffered from attacks by the Democrats during the nomination process.
The Kavanaugh Congressional Hearing took place on Thursday. He emotionally and emphatically denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually molested her decades earlier in her youth.
Ford also made statements about the allegations at the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that "the American people experienced the genius, character and courage that day" from Kavanaugh.
Addressing the massive West Virginia following, he stated, “Judge Kavanaugh is a law school graduate with a civil service history of the highest quality; a vote for his accreditation is a vote for the accreditation of one of the best lawyers of the modern age. "
With his remark about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president alluded to the appointment of Kavanaugh through the flower.
“One of the most important elections of our lives will take place in five weeks.
He said: "I have the feeling that I am already in the middle of the election campaign, and it has not even started yet."
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
According to Trump, the stated goal of the Democratic Party is "to oppose him and make his actions more difficult".
As a top Republican politician told CNN, it can be assumed that the Senate will vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh for the first time on Friday at the latest.
The death toll after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is already several hundred and is still rising.
The island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was officially reportedly hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami on Saturday. At least 384 people were killed, many of them were swept away by the gigantic waves on the beach.
Several hundred people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the coast was hit by waves six meters high at sunset, claiming innumerable victims and causing enormous damage.
The tsunami occurred as a result of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Sutoo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian civil protection agency BNPB, said at a briefing in Jakarta: "The people on the beach ignored the danger of the tsunami yesterday and did not leave the beach immediately, and they are the victims."
"Cars and houses were destroyed by the tsunami," said Nugroho, adding that it could reach speeds of 800 km / h over the open sea before it reached land.
He stated that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and saved their lives.
Almost 16,700 people have been brought to safety in 24 assembly points in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Civil Protection Agency showed many broken buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the city on the coast suffered further aftershocks.
The earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
According to the Indonesian Authority for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT), Friday's powerful quake had about 200 times the amount of energy released by the atomic bomb on Hiroshima during World War II.
They said the size of the tsunami could have worsened due to the city's geographic location on a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the property damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of buildings, including residential buildings, clinics, shopping centers and hotels, collapsed.
He said some dead were found among the remains of the destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
In the coastal area of Donggala, which is 300 km north of Palu and closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, the damage and the number of victims could be even greater, Nugroho fears.
According to Nugroho, no means of communication were intact and accordingly there was no news from Donggala.
It is home to more than 300,000 people, ”said the Red Cross, noting that there were both its own employees and volunteers on their way to the affected area.
According to the group, although it is already a drama, it is possible that things will get worse.
Although staff said the waves came at the time they were warned, the authorities were widely reprimanded on Saturday for failing to announce that a tsunami had struck Palu.
On amateur videos that have appeared in the media, one can hear the screams of a man from the upper floors of a building warning people on the street of the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, such a flood fell on the bank that buildings and vehicles were washed away.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a major power outage, which disrupted communications in the Palu area and made it more difficult for the authorities to coordinate the aid teams.
Since the people brought to safety still depend on a quick supply of food and other elementary things, the army initiated, according to the public authorities, the dispatch of aids with cargo planes from Jakarta to other cities.
The city airport is only open to emergency response workers and will remain closed for all other flights until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is already over 800.
It is extremely bitter.
Doseba stated that the employees of World Vision from Donggala had reached the city of Palu safely and were housed there in tents in the courtyard of their offices, but had seen devastating scenes on their way.
He described: "They said that they saw many houses destroyed."
This is extremely unfavorable.
The complaints that experienced disaster relief workers from abroad had no way of getting to Palu did not decline even after aid organizations had already started to work there.
In Indonesia, funds, supplies and personnel from abroad can only be claimed if a national emergency is declared for the location of the disaster.
That has not happened so far.
"It is still a disaster for the province," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
“International aid organizations can only become active if the government declares the whole thing a national catastrophe. But so far no such report has been made.
At the beginning of the second night after the earthquake and tsunami over Palu on Friday, friends and relatives of those still missing clung to the hope that their loved ones would be among the miracles that sometimes lighten the dark headlines after natural disasters.
A young boy was found in the sewers on Saturday.
A woman who was buried under the rubble next to her dead mother for over two days was brought to safety by rescue workers on Sunday.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paraglider team, covered two of the missing athletes he himself had trained for the Asian Games.
Those stranded at the Hotel Roa Roa included Mr. Mandagi and his students.
"For a professional paraglider like me that is a real mental burden," he said.
Gendon again described how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel became known among paragliders, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who were taking part in the beach festival.
But his message was only confirmed with two gray instead of two blue ticks.
He stated that he believed that this meant the news had not been delivered.
Refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee resulted in the theft of $ 26,750
According to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department, an employee of the Brink‘s security company who was busy loading an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning was stolen by thieves for $ 26,750.
Commissioner Dennis McCarthy announced in a press release that the driver of the car had emptied an ATM in an entertainment facility and was in the process of adding more money.
The Brink clerk was busy when another man quickly approached him from behind and stole a sack of cash that was to be delivered.
According to witness statements, several suspicious people have fled the scene. However, the police did not provide any information on the number of people involved in the incident.
If you have any information about their identities, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West renames himself to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
On Saturday, he anticipated the change on Twitter with this tweet: "The person officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West, who has been nicknamed Ye for some time, chose this title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where the presentation of his new album Yandhi is expected.
According to the show's organizers, he is representing Ariana Grande after she canceled her performance for "emotional reasons".
The word is an abbreviation of his current stage name, but, as West had said earlier, it also has a special religious significance for him.
"Ye is probably the most frequently used word in the Bible and means you," West said at the beginning of the year in an interview with the radio station Big Boy.
“In other words, it's us, I am we, you are me.
Kanye, whose name means 'the only one', becomes Ye - so he is a reflection of both our good and our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of ourselves. "
He is part of a number of well-known rappers who have already changed their names.
He prefers the stage names Love and Brother Love this year, explained Sean Combs, who became famous as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy.
JAY-Z, who previously also cooperated with West, has meanwhile also agreed to spelling his name without hyphens and capital letters.
The Mexican President AMLO promises to refrain from using the military against civilians
In the run-up to the 50th anniversary of a bloody suppression of students, the would-be Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised not to use military force against civilians under any circumstances.
Lopez Obrador's promise in Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday was that there would never be any military repression of Mexico's residents.
On October 2nd, 1968, a peaceful protest by left-wing students was violently ended by armed troops. Around 300 people were killed.
Lopez Obrador promised to give Mexican students financial support every month and to build additional free public universities.
The reasons why young people go into criminal gangs are unemployment and a lack of opportunities for training, he explained.
The US should double the budget for artificial intelligence
According to investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, it would be advisable for the US to double its research effort as long as China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence.
These demands were made after announcements by the American government about AI, as the USA does not have a formal AI strategy.
Last year, China presented its plan that it wants to be at the forefront of innovations in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Given that all other countries are far behind the United States, doubling your spending on AI research would be a good start. We are also on the verge of a breakthrough in AI research, ”said Lee.
Doubling funding could also double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in Face ++, one of the best-known AI companies in China , made.
The AI system he had worked on at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s was able to beat America's top-ranked Othello player. He later held an executive position at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's China office.
Lee pays tribute to previous technology competitions by the American government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's Robotics Challenge. He asked about the next date for such a competition, as it was a good way to identify new visionaries.
Lee said, "In the United States, researchers are often required to work hard to get government funding."
"It is not China that is causing the brain drain, it is companies," Lee noted.
In recent years, technology companies such as Facebook and Google have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, a different immigration policy could also help the US to focus more on Artificial Intelligence.
"I think PhD students in AI should be able to get green cards easily," he said.
In July 2917, the State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation can be compared to the US National Science Foundation and similar government institutions in that it finances academic research. However, according to Lee, the level of research in China is lower.
At the beginning of the year, the US Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is supposed to involve various partners from industry and science. The White House has also announced that it intends to set up a special committee for artificial intelligence.
This month DARPA announced a $ 2 billion initiative called "AI Next".
The NSF currently invests over $ 100 million annually in research on artificial intelligence.
Months have passed without hearing any of the US law regarding the establishment of a national artificial intelligence safety committee.
Macedonia: referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday a referendum took place in Macedonia on whether the country should be officially renamed the “Republic of North Macedonia”. The background to this is a decade-long dispute with Greece, on the basis of which the latter had prevented Macedonia's attempts to join the EU and NATO, and which would be resolved by the name change.
Greece with its province of Macedonia sticks to its opinion that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory. Accordingly, Athens vetoed the country's admission to NATO and the EU.
Patriotic opponents argue that the name change, which is to be made as part of the June agreement between the two states based on the recommended new name, weakens the ethnic identity of the predominantly Slavic citizens of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov indicated that he would not take part in the referendum himself. With regard to a campaign to boycott the referendum, there are doubts as to whether the voter turnout will exceed the 50 percent threshold - however, this is absolutely necessary for the vote to be valid.
The ballot paper for the referendum asked: "Do you vote to join NATO and the EU and accept the agreement with Greece?"
Those who, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of a name change say that it is worthwhile to continue the accession process of Macedonia, a state emerging after the collapse of Yugoslavia, into institutions such as the EU and NATO.
“I'm here today because I want to have a say in the future of the country. A free life under the umbrella of the European Union means a safer life, and I want to make this possible for young people and all Macedonians with my choice, ”explains 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska from Skopje.
Even if it is not a legally binding vote, many MPs have assured that they will base their actions on the outcome so that the election has real decision-making power.
A two-thirds majority is required in parliament to change the name.
At around 1 p.m., the state election committee announced that no irregularities had been reported.
But only 16 percent of those eligible to vote cast their vote - in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, it was 34 percent at the same time, with the final turnout being 66 percent.
A 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje, Gjose Tanevski, said that he had cast his vote in the face of his children, as families in Europe have their place in Europe.
Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko have voted for the referendum in Macedonia on a change of the country's name, which could result in NATO accession and EU membership on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia agreed.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkow set up a stage in front of the parliament in the capital Skopje and placed chairs in front of the tents of those who are boycotting the referendum.
"We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to act with our heads held high and at eye level," said Kavadarkov.
"Our country is poor, but we too have our dignity."
As Macedonia, if you do not grant us membership, we have other options, such as Euro-Asian integration via China and Russia. "
Prime Minister Zaev hopes that NATO membership will make urgently needed investments in Macedonia, a country where 20% of the population is unemployed.
After Zaev had voted, he said: "I think that by far most people will vote yes, because over 80 percent of the locals support the EU and NATO."
It should be interpreted as an “encouragement for our time to come” if the result is “yes”.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a poll which showed that only between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote - less than necessary.
According to another survey by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 percent of those surveyed will take part in the vote on Sunday.
70 percent of the people who intend to take part want to vote “yes”.
The referendum is only valid if more than half of all eligible voters take part.
Should the referendum fail, it could be a severe setback for the Western-minded government that took office in May last year.
Video: So Sergio Agüero of Manchester United fought his way through the complete Brighton defense to the goal.
Against Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling, Brighton's defenders had no chance on Saturday and Manchester City won the game at Etihad Stadium in their hometown 2-0.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute seemed incredibly easy.
The Argentine forward was in midfield when he accepted a pass at the start of the play.
To clear himself, he outsmarted three Brighton defenders.
Suddenly there were three green shirts around Aguero.
He ran away from some players on the border of the Brighton sixteen after initially evading a defender.
With a pass to the left, he passed the ball to Sterling.
The English attacker used the first contact with the ball to return it to Agüero, who then played with his right foot - past Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and into the right side of the goal.
City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists that Aguero had "problems with his feet".
“He played 55, 60 minutes; we exchanged views on the matter.
It happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal at that moment. "
However, it was Sterling who initially helped the Sky Blues lead in the Premier League duel:
The goal fell in the 29th minute.
During the game, Aguero got the ball when it was deep in the Brighton area.
with a skilful steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left outside.
Sane made a few touches of the ball first, then sent Sterling to the far post.
After moving the play equipment forward into the goal, the Sky Blues slid off the field.
City versus Hoffenheim will play in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim.
Against the Rockies, Scherzer would like to give the skeptic
There was little reason to insist on an additional start because the playoff competitors had excluded the national team.
The ambitious Scherzer, on the other hand, hopes to be able to stand on the hill in the game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday - but only if there are still playoff chances for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
With their 5-2 win over the Nationals, the Rockies were able to move up at least one place. However, the title is still not certain for the first division.
“This year we will probably experience nothing better than the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the opposing team. That's why we'll make an effort, even if it doesn't work out in the end.
I don't see any reason why I shouldn't feel like trying hard. "
The Nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday, but they tend to throw jokes in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, threw an upward tour on Thursday and threw in his normal rest day.
That season, the Washington right-hander scored 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump goes on an election campaign tour in West Virginia
While discussing Republican involvement in the interim figures, the President cross-referenced the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court.
November is about all of our previous successes.
In five weeks there will be one of the most important elections we have ever seen.
He said, "I stand up for great candidates everywhere because I don't stand for election, but I stand for election - this one is one of the important, important ones."
"You see this awful, awful group of radical Democrats, you see that it is happening right now," Trump continues.
Their goal is to regain power, no matter what the cost, and malice and meanness can also be a means to an end.
They don't care who they hurt, who to ignore in order to gain power and control. That's exactly what they want, power and control, but they don't get it from us.
"The Democrats want to stand up and block," he said.
“And that has become clear in the past four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “angry and mean, malicious and lying”.
He named the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who holds a high position in the Senate Legal Committee, and was greeted with loud protests from the public for this.
“Do you remember what her answer was?
Have you passed the documents on to the public?
No what.
Wait a minute - the body language really wasn't good at all - I've never seen body language this terrible before.
The Labor Party has lost its size as a community.
It is not tolerant on the part of those who openly express their thoughts.
It came as no surprise that Momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me personally.
I am not the first Labor Party MP to be told that he is not welcome - and that is only because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan from my group has experienced something similar to my own after taking a firm stand against anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for the motion of censure for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It is not without irony that these are matters - the importance of sound economic policies, external security, Europe - on which Jeremy took a different stance than former heads of state and government.
"We want the meetings to sell inclusive and productive," read the message from the Labor Party meeting in East Nottingham.
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings during my eight-year tenure as the local Labor representative were identical.
Many encounters today are characterized by a different tone and no one thinks of the promise of a "friendlier, gentler" policy, if it was ever really thought of.
It became increasingly clear that there was no place for diversity in the Labor Party, and all views should be in line with the line of the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy took office. All of a sudden, colleagues, where I actually had your impression that we were quite similar in our political opinion, assumed that I had to do a 180-degree turn and support views that were completely opposite to my position, for example on issues such as national Security or the European internal market.
Every time I say something in public - no matter what I say - I experience wild insults on social media, people are asked to vote out, center politics are under fire and I am told that I must not join Labor Belong to party.
I was not alone in this experience.
Since most of the articles addressed to me relate to politics, I am doing better than some of my colleagues at work, I am well aware of that.
I respect my colleagues for their professionalism and determination. They are confronted massively with sexist or racist abuse every day, but they cannot be stopped.
Arguably what is most disappointing about this political age is the normalization of such levels of abuse.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said the Labor Party should advocate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is, we are no longer a broad-based church; the community is getting smaller with every motion of no confidence and every change in the selection rules.
I should make myself small and express my opinion less, then I would be “ok” - this has been advised to me many times in the past two years.
But that was not the incentive for my entry into politics.
I joined the Labor Party as a student 32 years ago. The reason was the indifference of the Thatcher administration which left my classroom in a totally neglected state. Accordingly, I have campaigned for improvements in public services - for those who need them most, and that could be anyone from councilors to ministers.
In the last election, too, I made no secret of my political views.
Surely no one in Nottingham East was confused by my political stance. This also applies to areas where I do not agree with the current management team.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the motion submitted on Friday that I cannot understand why they are spending time and energy demonstrating loyalty to me and the Labor Party as Brexit approaches and causes problems for households, companies and our public services becomes.
But my only message is momentum, not for Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are Labor or not: I am proud to serve you, and I pledge that no threats to vote out or political tactics will deter them from doing so do what I believe is in everyone's best interests.
The MP for Nottingham East is Chris Leslie
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr with no losses in first place
Ayr is the deserved winner of today's Tennent‘s Premiership Match, which was wonderfully entertaining, although two of his later attempts may have slightly affected the outcome.
The team is not only ahead in the table, but is also the only one of the ten teams that has survived the season without a loss.
In the end, the decisive factor was, in addition to the better utilization of chances, the first-class defense of the home team, which coach Peter Murchie was happy about.
"Our games have put us to the test and we are undefeated so far, so I have to be happy," he said.
"Thanks to Ayr, they have made better use of the opportunities they had," said Melrose player Robyn Christie.
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead. However, due to a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes from the against the Warriors, Melrose outnumbered and Jason Baggot failed to convert one attempt.
Climo gave Ayr the lead with a penalty, then scored at halftime and finally, thanks to his solo attempt, Ayr took a 17-5 break lead.
In the second half, Melrose made a promising start. Baggot was able to convert Patrick Anderson's attempt, with only five points remaining.
The injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to leave the field on a stretcher, caused a long interruption. When the game resumed, Ayr pushed ahead with a try from Stafford McDowall who was converted by Climo.
At the end of a high pressure curse for a yellow card for current Ayr captain Blair Macpherson, Melrose punished the new player with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine.
The home team were catching up, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling Climos without the ball out of the box, MacPherson touched down with the advancing Ayr behind him.
Just like shortly after kick-off, Climo transformed after David Armstrong's boxkick was broken by Kyle Rowe and winger Gregor Henry sent a pass to number five.
Still Game star is planning a new career in hospitality
After his appointment as managing director of a licensed restaurant became known, it is believed that Star Ford Kieran will move into the hotel business.
The 56-year-old not only writes the popular BBC series with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill, but also plays the role of Jack Jarvis.
The duo announced that Kiernan is on the show and making plans for Craiglang.
According to entries in the official company register, he is the managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor was not supposed to comment, but a source in Scotland said Kiernan's intentions were to join Glasgow's "successful restaurant scene".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, completely enclosed by land, hopes the court will grant the land direct access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors keep watch in front of a roped naval headquarters in La Paz
Sea-blue flags fly on public buildings.
The bases of the navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are under the motto "The sea is ours".
This is a must for recovery to take place.
All over Bolivia, with its enclosed location, still remembers a coast that fell to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century, and still feels the need to cross the Pacific again.
With the International Court of Justice due to deliver a judgment on October 1st after more than five years of deliberation, hopes in Bolivia may be at their highest level in decades.
Diplomat Roberto Calzadilla from Bolivia said: “Bolivia has the dynamism, the sense of unity and the ability to remain calm. Therefore, of course, the result is positive. "
Many residents of Bolivia will wait for the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens all over the country and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in the interests of Bolivia, so that, after decades of heated discussions, about the granting of Chile direct access to the ocean for Bolivia must become.
Monday's decision is extremely important to Bolivia's charismatic indigenous President Evo Morales - who faces a controversial re-election battle next year.
"We will soon regain access to the Pacific," he vowed at the end of August.
In the opinion of some analysts, however, it cannot be assumed that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia. And even if it did, it would probably not change the situation.
Since the UN agency from the Netherlands does not have the right to transfer territories that are owned by Chile, it has decided to hold back on any negotiation results.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert, the ruling of the International Court of Justice six months after hearing the closing arguments showed that the case was "straightforward".
The past four years may have pushed the issue further into the background and Bolivia is far from taking its cause forward.
"The current government of Bolivia is using the debate about access to the sea for its own purposes," said Zárate.
She argued that because of Morales' combative language, none of the remaining Chilean favor was left.
In the following period, Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at an unspecified time, but it will be difficult to continue the talks afterwards.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and current representative of Bolivia in The Hague, denied that the court ruling had been made unusually quickly.
He said Bolivia will be given "an exceptional chance on Monday to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" as well as "end the 139-year era of disagreement that both benefited from."
When asked whether Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was instrumentalizing the issue of sea access for his political goals, Calzadilla also said no.
"Bolivia will never give up its access to the Pacific," he added.
"Our obligation to leave the past behind is the knowledge that can be derived from the result."
According to North Korea, nuclear disarmament is impossible as long as there is no trust in the US.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho noted that his country could never take the first step in nuclear dismantling if there was no trust in Washington.
Ri delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to keep the promises they had made at the summit meeting between the heads of state of the two warring countries.
Three months after the talks with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore, it seems that the American Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wants to build on these with his comments. In the meantime, there had been radio silence with regard to denuclearization.
The fact that the North could give up because of the ongoing sanctions and America's objection to the announcement of an end to the Korean War is "mere wishful thinking," said Ri.
Consent from Washington can only be expected once the disarmament on the part of Pyongyang takes place in full.
A second summit is desired by both Kim and US President Donald Trump.
It is generally doubted that Pyongyang will actually do without its arsenal, because the country sees it as the only option to guarantee its security.
In preparation for the number two summit between Trump and Kim, Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month.
The oversized hats of which the latest collections are presented at fashion shows in Paris are increasingly appearing on the streets around you.
We are the right address for you if you want to add another item to your hat collection or just want to completely protect yourself from the sun.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought out some fancy, oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk. These caused enthusiasm at Paris Fashion Week.
A wave of extremely inconvenient hats swept across Instagram this summer, and these designers let models walk the runway with their striking creations.
The most eye-catching item in Valentino's collection was an exaggerated, beige hat, the feather-like, wide brim of which protruded over the heads of the models.
There were also oversized accessories such as watermelons with jewelry, a magician's hat and even a pineapple. However, it is not their job to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne performed a series of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the brightly colored masks had sewn up mouths and evoked memories of Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One suggestion looked like diving gear with snorkel and goggles, another looked like a melted sundae.
And if you follow this incredible fashion trend, you are in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs expect to see the giant hats on the main streets near you soon.
"La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide brim that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wears, was immediately followed by the oversized hats.
After spreading the extremely impractical hat on social media, the cult brand presented another great idea on the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost the size of the model it was holding in its hands.
The most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week was an orange raffia bag with a raffia hem and a white leather handle.
“We will see large headgear and beach bags on the streets next summer, that is my forecast. You can't just ignore the interest in huge accessories because the designer can influence them considerably, ”the well-known stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL.
John Edward: It is essential for global citizens to be proficient in languages
The Independent Schools of Scotland have a long track record of academic standards, as evidenced by the latest excellent exam results from 2018. In addition, individual and group successes have been recorded in the areas of sport, art, music and other joint ventures.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best education and service to their over 30,000 students across Scotland.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare the pupils - for a further educational institution, including universities, for the desired professional career and for their place as citizens of the world.
Development and implementation of an individual curriculum are an option that the education sector offers us. We noticed that modern languages are still enjoying great popularity and great interest in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you want to reach someone's mind, speak to them in the language they understand."
It touches him emotionally when you talk to him in his mother tongue. "
This is an impressive demonstration of the fact that relying on English as a means of communication is not enough when it comes to establishing relationships and trust with people from abroad.
The fact that languages are at the top of the lists with the proportion of passed exams in independent schools can be seen when looking at the results of the schoolwork.
Of all students who have learned a foreign language, 68% have achieved the so-called "Higher Grade A", level C2.
Data collected from 74 member schools of the SCIS show that 72 percent of students achieved Higher Grade A in Standard Chinese, while among those learning German, French and Spanish, 72 percent, 69 percent and 63 percent, respectively Percent got the grade "A".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The curricula of independent schools and elsewhere place the same emphasis on language subjects as they do on MINT subjects (mathematics, information technology, science and technology).
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacant positions were due to a lack of language skills.
In order to be prepared for their careers, the command of foreign languages is becoming increasingly important.
Foreign language skills are of paramount importance in a globalized world because they offer great career opportunities.
Once someone has learned to speak another language, this ability is a lifetime asset, regardless of the career one pursues.
By being able to communicate directly with foreigners, multilingual people will automatically have an advantage over their competition.
In the UK, three quarters of people did not have sufficient foreign language skills to take part in a conversation, and only French had a double-digit command, according to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adult respondents.
It is therefore important to invest in language training for children now.
Children who learn several languages - especially those spoken in developing countries - have better prospects in the labor market later on.
The Scottish schools offer a variety of language courses.
Some of the schools focus on the common modern languages, while others teach languages that are of particular importance for Great Britain with a view to 2020, including Standard Chinese and Japanese.
In free schools, your child will always be able to choose from several foreign languages, regardless of their interests, and teachers will be available who are experts in their field,
It is the declared aim of independent Scottish schools to provide a learning environment in which children are well prepared. Here you should get the basics for future success, no matter what that future looks like.
In today's global business world, languages will undoubtedly play a major role in the future of the country, which must also be reflected in the education system.
Contemporary languages should be viewed as "international communication skills".
Young people will continue to find such services, spectrum and top quality in independent schools in Scotland in the future.
We must do it well.
John Edward heads the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron's first game for the Lakers will take place in San Diego on Sunday
Fans are looking forward to soon showing their support for LeBron James when he hits the field with the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
James is due to play against the Denver Nuggets in the opening game of the preseason on Sunday in San Diego, according to Lakers coach Luke Walton.
But it is not yet known how many minutes he will ultimately be on the field.
On the Lakers' official website, Walton stated, "It will be more than one and less than 48."
James will probably not be used for the full duration of the game, according to Lakers journalist Mike Trudell in a tweet.
Earlier this week, after training, James was asked what he planned for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career, there is no pre-season preparation required," he said.
YouTube channel, Trump's rally in West Virginia
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virgini, President Donald Trump is holding the first in a long series of whale fighting events.
It's the first leg of next week's election rally tour. Among other things, Trump will also perform in the states of Tennessee and Mississippi, which are pro-Republican.
Meanwhile, Trump is waiting at the same time for his candidate for the vacancy to be accepted by the Supreme Court and trying to mobilize his voters for the upcoming mid-term elections - if he does not succeed, it is to be feared that the Republicans will have theirs after the elections in November Lose Congress Majority.
What time is Trump's West Virginia Rally tonight and what is the option to watch it online?
Trump's campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 ET that evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's speech at the West Virginia rally live stream online on YouTube below.
Trump can be expected to comment on this week's interviews in connection with allegations that Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's candidate for a post on the Supreme Court, has committed sexual abuse. Therefore, Kavanaugh's confirmation in office, which is to be carried out by the Senate, has been postponed for at least a week until the end of the investigation carried out by the FBI.
Mobilizing the Republicans, for whom the November election is particularly important, is the main concern of these political events.
According to Reuters, Trump's campaign plans to mobilize volunteers and supporters to maintain and strengthen the Republican majority in the Senate and House of Representatives after next week's five election rallies.
“For the president, a majority in Congress is his highest political goal. That is the reason for his numerous appearances in different states before the start of the turbulent election campaign, "said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who wishes to remain anonymous, told Reuters.
Supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as the Pittsburgh press are also likely to be interested in the election rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, according to West Virginia MetroNews.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time this month. In 2016 he won more than 40 percent of the vote.
Patrick Morrisey, a polled Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate who was rejected by the polls, receives support from Trump.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said, according to Reuters, that having the president come to improve his poll results does not speak for Morrisey.
Ryder Cup 2018: In order to be able to continue to hope for the individual matches on Sunday, Team USA takes on the fight.
For the Ryder Cup, the Foursomes were probably just the thing on Saturday afternoon after three unbalanced games.
The swinging pendulum is a fictitious idea in sport, but it is popular with players, especially in competitions of this kind.
In your opinion, where do you notice the dynamics at this moment?
“Her lead was previously six points, now four. So it seems that this will give us some momentum, ”explained Jordan Spieth before retiring for the rest of the day.
With 12 points still outstanding, Europe is of course in the lead with 4 points.
Spieth said, however, that the Americans felt a little upswing and felt encouraged, also by the good form of Spieth and Justin Thomas. The two had played together all day and both got three out of four points each.
Spieth stood out as being stronger and was a good role model for everyone else.
After two matches, he and Thomas were still two points behind, but the hoarse hoot increased in volume as he pushed the decisive putt into the hole in the further course of his round, thereby creating a draw in the fourth match.
He was so enthusiastic about the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game that one could assume that he still had hopes for the victory of the American team.
Spieth explained: "It is important that you only think about your own game and that you really concentrate."
There is no other option for these players.
18 holes that impress.
At this Ryder Cup, Franceso Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were undoubtedly the only two players who scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
The eccentric but respectable duo from Europe make no mistakes and deliver a perfect game.
"Moliwood" were the only ones who didn't score a bogey on Saturday afternoon. On Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning they also managed to avoid finishing in the last nine places.
When the tournament at Le Golf National draws to a close at sunset, Fleetwood or Molinari would be the most popular players who could bring Europe's potential victory under wraps - especially because of their run and the way they sparked the spark Audience skips and vice versa, are considered favorites for Sunday anyway.
Probably both at the same time on different holes.
It would be too early to assume that the Europeans will win now.
Webb Simpson and Bubba Watson gave Sergio Garcia, who won the morning with his partner Alex Noren, practically no chance.
Due to a bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes, the situation for the Spaniard and the Swede was completely deadlocked.
But on Sundays there is no one to pull you up again.
Fourballs and foursomes can be particularly fascinating when viewed up close - not least because of how the pairings interact with one another, which advice is given or should have been given, and how strategies can be turned upside down in seconds.
The Europeans were better as a team in terms of play and have gained a clear lead in the last few days, but this foursome session also shows that the Americans are combative. This had been questioned by some in advance.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads 10–6
On Saturday, Europe took the lead in the four and four-man games 10-6 ahead of the USA and will capitalize on this convincing lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari had defeated Tiger Woods twice and now took the group lead at Le Golf National with a total of four points.
The winner of the series was Thomas Bjorn's European team with 3-1, who wanted to get back the trophy that it had lost in Hazeltine two years earlier. The partially inattentive Americans were inferior at the fourballs in the morning.
The Americans put up more resistance in the four and won twice, but they could not deal with the deficit.
If Jim Furyk's team is to continue to call the trophy their own, it will have to score eight points in the twelve individual games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row. At the same time he and Molinari, jointly referred to as "Molliwood" after the sensations of the weekend, are only the second duo ever to take four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After the success against Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, an even clearer 5 & 4 against a disappointed Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau seemed guaranteed.
During two slow games on Saturday there was one or the other brilliant action by Woods, but the bottom line was that he failed in 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson during the foursome and won 2 & 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - first and third in the world rankings.
However, not everything should go according to the EU's expectations on this mild, breezy day in the south-west of Paris.
On Saturday, the Americans had to prove themselves to be equal to the three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas with two points.
They bravely beat Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a pack of four with 2-1 and later, after a defeat on the first two holes, they managed a 4-3 victory against Poulter and Rory McIllroy in a pack of four.
A draw is enough for Halter Furyk's team to defend the Cup, but only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team been able to achieve victory after being four points behind at the start of the individual matches.
After two days in second place on the best time list, after Sunday's counterattack it looks like things could go even higher.
North Korea declares that without a basis of trust, it will "under no circumstances" disarm itself
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister told the UN that maintaining the sanctions would increase his distrust of the US and that unilateral denuclearization would be impossible under these conditions.
Speaking to the UN's annual general assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting testing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, dismantling the nuclear test site and an obligation not to To contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"There is no such answer from the US," he said.
"Trust in the security of our country will not be possible without trust in the USA, and in view of this situation the option of us being the first to unilaterally disarm ourselves is not given."
As expected from North Korea, Ri complained that the US is critical of the idea of “successive” denuclearization, in which the country is gradually rewarded. However, compared to previous statements by the North Korean government, it is noteworthy that it was not entirely opposed to a unilateral renunciation of nuclear weapons.
Ri pointed to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump that emerged on June 12 at the first summit of an incumbent US president with a North Korean leader in Singapore. In this Kim had undertaken to strive for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula". In return, Trump had guaranteed the security of North Korea,
North Korea wanted to officially end the Korean War between 1950 and 1953. However, the US had insisted that the north must first be denuclearized.
Washington also disagrees with demands to ease the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The USA cannot be dissuaded from its “denuclearization first” approach (denuclearization as the first requirement). To achieve this goal, they increase the pressure through sanctions and do not even accept a "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that we would allow ourselves to be brought to our knees by sanctions is nothing but wishful thinking from those who have no idea about us."
The continued sanctions fuel our suspicion, that is the real difficulty. "
A second summit between Kim and Trump was not an issue for Ri, even if the American president spoke enthusiastically about one at the UN at the beginning of the week.
The three talks between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the President of South Korea, during the past five months were of particular importance to the minister and he added: “If the negotiations on nuclear weapons dismantling took place with South Korea instead of with the US, the situation would not be proceed as at the moment. "
However, the tone that Ri took in his speech was completely different from his speech at the UN last year. The fact that “Mr. Evil President "Trump had dubbed Kim as a" rocket man "on a suicide mission, had inevitably led to everything revolving around the US and the North Korean missiles at the General Assembly.
After threatening the “complete destruction” of North Korea last year, Trump was very positive about Kim and his commitment to disarming the UN assembly this year, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea was denuclearized.
"Whether the duration is five, 24 or 36 months is irrelevant," said Trump, so he has no time schedule for the matter.
If it were up to China and Russia, North Korea should receive a reward from the UN Security Council for progress.
On Thursday, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the following to the UN Security Council in the USA: "We must continue the sanctions of the Security Council with determination and without exception until the complete, final and confirmed denuclearization is achieved."
The sanctions against North Korea have been increased again and again since 2006 without a dissenting vote in the UN Security Council. This was intended to prevent Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
On the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Pompeo and Ri met. The former then announced that he would fly back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he spoke of the progress that had been made. A few hours later, however, North Korea condemned him for his “mafia demands”.
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and nuclear complex if the US takes "right steps".
According to his statement, Kim described the proposed "appropriate measures" as security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and as steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard University students take a rest class.
At Harvard University, all students can sleep more this year thanks to a new course that counteracts the increasing macho culture in college and "long nights" full of caffeine.
Scientists have found that students at one of the world's leading universities are often unable to help themselves, even if it only takes very simple procedures.
The course was developed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Medical Specialist at Brigham and Women‘s Hospital. In his opinion, no such course has ever existed in the USA.
A presentation on the effects of sleep deprivation on the ability to learn that he had given earlier served as inspiration for the course.
After the event, a girl approached me and asked: "Why am I only finding out now, in my final year?"
He told the Telegraph that she said she had never been told the importance of sheep before and that he did not expect it.
The elementary things, e.g. In the seminar, which is taking place for the first time this year, the students learn about the positive influence that good sleep hygiene has on performance in class, in sports and on general well-being.
The university recognized that students were getting far too little sleep during the week and decided to offer the seminar, according to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services.
Several interactive exercises are part of the 60-minute learning event.
For information about the effects of caffeine and light on sleep, the impact of sleep deprivation on exercise performance and the importance of a bedtime routine, students can refer to the bedroom illustration shown in a section Click coffee mug, curtains, tutor and books.
In another chapter, learners learn how sleep deprivation is a risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Using a map of the campus with interactive symbols, the participants should reflect on their everyday life.
It will not cause an immediate change in the behavior of the students, we know that.
"However, it is our opinion that it is your right - just as it is your right to find out what health consequences the decision to smoke cigarettes has", added Prof. Czeisler.
He said there was still a culture of pride in "going through the night," adding that sleep deprivation is becoming an increasing problem with modern technology and increasing pressure on students.
He said that getting enough and good sleep is a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety. It also helps you stop gaining weight, because lack of sleep ensures that the brain sends out "hunger signals" and that you are constantly hungry.
Professor Czeisler was assisted in preparing the course by Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California who was enrolled in one of Czeisler's courses at Harvard last year.
The seminar shook him up and prompted him to promote a university-wide seminar, he said.
He hoped that the next step would be that all doctoral students would be asked to complete a comparable study program before they come to one of the universities participating in the competition.
Prof. Czeisler advised the students to set an alarm when to go to bed and when to get up and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light". This is emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which mess up the day / night rhythm and thus lead to difficulties in falling asleep.
Livingston 1, Rangers 0: Menga's goal brings Gerrard's squad back down to earth
The Rangers continue to struggle with away games: Steven Gerrard's split side lost 1-0 in Livingston after a goal by Dolly Menga.
The Ibrox team were aiming for their first win after their 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February. But Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second setback in 18 games as coach, leaving his team 8 points behind Hearts, the dissatisfied Ladbrokes Premiership boss.
After Menga scored seven minutes before half-time, no one expected the Rangers' less creative line-up to equalize.
Livingston made a leap in the table and is now only in 3rd place behind Hibernian because of the worse goal difference, while the Rangers are only in 6th place.
After linesman Calum Spence had to be hit in the head by an object apparently thrown from the area of the supporters of the guest team and had to be medically treated, the Rangers probably had to face further problems.
Gerrard made eight changes and the players beat Ayr to go straight to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, who called on the same Livi team as the week before when they reached a draw at Hearts, was delighted to see how his well-drilled team never gave the other side room to act.
In terms of possession, the Rangers were the stronger team, but Livingston made better use of his opportunities.
A huge opportunity in the second minute, when Scott Pittman ran into Allan McGregor's goal after a first pass from Menga, should have been a goal, but the midfielder missed the box with his shot.
Keaghan Jacobs took a long free kick to captain Craig Halket, but defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed a long shot to the back post.
Though the Rangers dominated the game, they seemed to be hoping more than really trusting their own game in the final third.
After the first quarter of an hour had passed, Alfredo Morelos apparently believed that a penalty was deserved after bumping into Steven Lawless. But referee Steven Thomson ignored all of the Colombian player's demands.
In the first half, the Rangers managed only two shots. But the former goalkeeper of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly unsettled by Lassana Coulibaly's plunge and the hit by a boring Ovie Ejaria.
Livi's 34th-minute goal may not have been in line with the rest of the game, but it can hardly be denied that they deserved it for their efforts alone.
The Rangers failed once again in a standard Jacobs situation.
After Declan Gallagher's pass to Scott Robinson, there was no response from Scott Arfield. However, Robinson remained composed and selected Menga for an easy graduation.
The half-time substitution, when Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, had an immediate impact on the game: the winger passed the ball to Morelos but Kelly, who showed an impressive performance, sprinted off his line to prevent it.
But Livingston always managed to get the guests to the kind of game they liked, and Lithgow and Halkett played the long balls in the process.
Holt's side could have taken the lead in the final phase, but McGregor managed to fend off Jacobs. It was followed by Lithgows header from the corner.
Rangers' Glenn Middleton received another penalty after an argument with Jacobs. However, Thomson looked away again.
The inventor of the Geiger counter: Almanac
The following is an excerpt from our almanac “Sonntagmorgen”: On September 30, 1882, over 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method by which radioactivity can be detected and measured - an invention that ultimately led to the device we know as a Geiger counter.
As in the 1950 film, "Bells of Coronado", with the cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who obviously cannot be scientists, the Geiger counter has since become a fixture in science.
“What is that supposed to be?” Asks a man.
Rogers explained, “It's a Geiger counter that can detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
With these headphones on, you can really perceive the effects of the atoms that are released by the radioactivity in the minerals. "
"Well, it's cracking a lot now," said Evans.
Hans Geiger died just a few days before he was 63 years old, in 1945.
The invention named after him is still in use.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "recognize" malignant cells.
The immune system can learn to “recognize” and eliminate malignant cells through an innovative vaccine against cancer.
Vaccine causes the body's defense system to recognize malignant parts of the body
In this procedure, immune cells are removed from patients and modified in the laboratory.
A protein that occurs in many different types of cancer is then visible, after which the injection can be continued.
An experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
Ovarian cancer in a woman who was vaccinated with a substance that teaches the immune system to identify rogue cells decreased over 18 months.
In this method, a patient's immune cells are extracted, modified in the laboratory to reveal the HER2 protein, which is linked to many types of cancer, and then re-injected.
The results would suggest that the discovered vaccine was extremely promising, said Professor Jay Berzofsky, employed at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Prof. Berzofsky explained that HER2 "contributes to the spread of different types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
In treating a variant of leukemia, it has already been found that a comparable approach, in which patients' immune cells are removed and these are made to attack cancer cells, works.
Kanye West wore a MAGA baseball cap for his appearance on Saturday Night Live and then gave an eulogy for Trump.
It wasn't great
In a rambling tirade during a Saturday Night Live broadcast, Kanye West received boos in the studio when he spoke positively about US President Trump and said he would run in 2020.
With a Make America Great hat on, he sang Ghost Town, his third song of the night, then turned the audience against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
"It often happens that in a conversation with a white person I hear:" Trump is a racist, what do you like about him? "
He said he would have left America long ago if he was worried about racism.
The Saturday Night Live Show started with a sketch in which Hollywood actor Matt Damon made Brett Kavanaugh's statements. Kavanaugh previously testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexually harassing her.
While the recordings of West's talk were never officially broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted them on social media platforms.
It's not clear whether Rock intended to make fun of West with this post.
West had also commented on the audience that he had problems in the backstage area because of his headgear.
“I was bullied by them behind the scenes.
"When you go out, leave the hat here," they said.
You made me very upset!
And then they notice that I am in a place without hope, ”he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
If I wanted to visit the submerged area, West asked further and said he would put on my Superman cape because then I would not be able to give him any instructions. Whether I want humanity to evolve.
You should try it with love. "
In at least two cases he was booed by the audience. The situation was apparently embarrassing for the comedians of the Saturday Night Live Show: “There was complete silence in the whole studio,” Variety quoted one of the viewers as saying.
Ariana Grande, who had lost her former boyfriend, rap artist Mac Miller a few days earlier, was replaced by West on short notice.
West disguised himself as a Perrier bottle for a performance of the song "I Love it", surprising many.
"This message goes to an intrepid soul: THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESISTANCE TO THE MAFIA," said a tweet in which Candace Turner, leader of the conservative organization TPUSA, showed his support for West.
However, talk show host Karen Hunter wrote in her tweet that West was "who he is and that's just fantastic".
"But I will not support anyone (by listening to their music or wearing their clothes or promoting their art) who I have the impression that they have and disseminate political views that harm those around me."
He is free.
She added, "So do we."
Before his appearance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had renamed himself and from now on will be called "the being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, but is also following the example of Diddy, who is also known under the names Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion. And then there was the later legendary music Prince, who first changed his name symbolically and then became famous with the name by which we know him today,
After stabbing a knife in a restaurant in Belfast: Public Prosecutors bring charges of attempted murder
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was killed with a knife in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The scene of the whole was Ballyhackamore, as the police announced.
The Belfast District Court is expecting the defendant at the appointment on Monday.
The public prosecutor's office is examining the various charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington displays toxic masculine behavior.
Kit Harrington became known for his role as the sword-throwing Jon Snow in HBO's martial medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
What bothers the 31-year-old actor is the stereotypically masculine hero character. He fears that such movie characters lead adolescent boys to think that they will only get recognition if they act particularly tough.
In his opinion, something has not worked properly, Kit explained in an interview with "The Sunday Times Culture", and asked the question of how the problematic phenomenon of toxic masculinity could be countered in a time marked by #MeToo debates.
After marrying 31-year-old Kit to co-star Rose Leslie, Kit confessed that he believed solving the problem was fundamental.
Right now I feel pretty confident - what went wrong with manhood? ”He asked.
What did we men raise in their youth about the problems we now face?
Kit believes that television, with its very masculine characters, is partly to blame for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He continued: What is innate, what is learned?
The question is, do little boys think what they learn on TV and on the street must have that typical masculine quality.
In my opinion, this is one of the really important questions of today - how can we do it differently?
For young men something has obviously gone wrong.
After the series ended in the summer, he had no desire to shoot a predecessor or successor series to Game of Thrones, he confessed in an interview and added that he had had enough of theaters of war and nagging.
Kit will play a new version of Sam Shepard's True West from November. The story tells of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently said that clashing with his wife Rose is the best Game of Thrones has made.
"This show gave me my future family and a different life because it was where I met my wife," he said.
In the fantasy series, which won an Emmy, Rose starred in the role of Ygritte, the lover of kit actor Jon Snow.
The couple's wedding took place in June 2018 on Leslie's Scottish family estate.
China: 14% increase in new HIV / AIDS cases
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14 percent.
According to health authorities, this affects 820,000 people in the country.
There were 40,000 new cases in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to previous records, the majority of the virus was transmitted through sexual intercourse in the new cases.
In some parts of China, HIV has spread rapidly through infected blood transfusions.
At a meeting in Yunnan Province, Chinese health officials said the number of people infected with HIV through this route had fallen to almost zero.
Compared to last year, 100,000 more people in China are now living with HIV and AIDS.
For the Chinese LGBT community, the risk of contracting HIV through sexual intercourse is very topical.
While homosexuality was not a crime in China since 1997, discrimination against the LGBT community is widespread.
Studies show that based on traditional values in their home country, 70 to 80 percent of men who have sexual intercourse with other men ultimately marry a woman.
These are diseases that are often transmitted through unprotected sex.
In 2003, the Chinese government made a promise to provide universal access to HIV medicines, which should contain the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the allegations that an employee has disclosed the data of Republican senators to the public and describes the allegations as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
A Maxine Waters employee reportedly released personal information about three Republican Senate members through their Wikipedia pages. The US MP spoke out against these allegations on Saturday.
For the Los Angeles Democrat, it is clear that the allegations by party members come from the political fringes and were published online.
"Falsehoods, falsehoods, nothing but falsehoods," Waters commented on Twitter.
The home addresses and phone numbers of the South Carolina-born US Senator Lindsey Graham and two US Senators from Utah, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, are also among the published data, according to reports.
This information was created by an anonymous source on Capitol Hill who posted it online during the ongoing Senate negotiation of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court on charges of sexual misconduct.
Shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned, the three senators' dates were made public.
According to Gateway Pundit, RedState and other conservative websites, there is a connection between the IP address that was determined as the origin and the Waters office. This is how the information about one of his employees should have come to the public, said Hill.
"This accusation is unfounded, completely inaccurate and totally a lie," Waters continued.
“The person among my employees - whose identity, personal information and data, and security were compromised by these unfair and inaccurate statements - was not responsible for any information leakage.
This groundless accusation is incorrect and inconsistent with the truth.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the Internet. One of the critics was Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
Fleischer commented: "It is very annoying to deny this."
“For us this leads to the conclusion that it is not suitable for the congress.
If someone is accused of an act, they shouldn't be angry about it.
You mustn't be naughty.
You are not allowed to express doubts about the plaintiff's reasons.
You have to be casual and relaxed. "
The way in which Water reacted was apparently equated by Fleischer with the complaint made by Judge Kavanaugh on the part of the Democrats, who accused him of appearing angry when questioned on Thursday.
Also active on Twitter is Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate and a competitor to Waters who does not currently hold a seat in the midterm elections.
His tweet was, "Big, if true."
Waters noted in her statement that her office “has notified the appropriate agencies and law enforcement agencies of the unfair claims.
She said: “We will see to it that the perpetrators are arrested and that they are held accountable for their actions which were destructive and dangerous for my co-workers.
Review: "Johnny English - You Only Live Three Times" - poorly cast satire with Rowan Atkinson
The first Johnny English film in the series of parodic action comedies was released in 2003 with Johnny English and was reissued in 2011 with "Johnny English Reborn" - yet the custom seems to be on the lookout for references to Brexit in every newer British-themed flick, to be used also for this new edition.
Could the country's new export opportunity be the self-deprecating satire about humanity at its abyss?
In any case, Johnny English, with his big eyes, rubber face, and inability to make a mess, got the second license. As his name suggests, he is a weird character who appeals to a lot of people and was not made up for cinema lovers whose first language is English.
Of course, he plays the bumbling secret guy who, despite his bizarre claims to glamor and glamor, unites a bit of Inspector Clouseau and Mr. Bean, and thus plays his part in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games.
The basis is the mysterious traveler who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV spots for Barclaycard and who always left chaos.
The latest Johnny English comedy has a few beautiful moments to offer.
My favorite scene was the one in which Johnny English walks up to a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor keeps banging against his headgear.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is recognizable, but it doesn't seem very funny and somehow dispensable, especially because "serious" films such as James Bond and Mission Impossible also use wit confidently.
I find the insane clumsiness of Johnny English less creative and bundled than Atkinson's silent films with Mr. Bean; the fun seems to appeal to children rather than adults.
That the British are in a problematic position has become a basic assumption.
To the horror of the agent responsible (Kevin Eldon in an unfortunately very small role), Her Majesty's top-secret espionage network was infiltrated by a hacker who revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground.
It's all that the equally ostentatious and contested figure of the Prime Minister can hold onto after her political standing has reached underground dimensions. Emma Thompson does not find it easy to portray the character, who has many parallels to Teresa May, because the script offers little basis for work.
She learns from her intelligence advisers that the cover of every single active spy has been blown and that she has to recall someone from retirement.
In other words, the awkward Johnny English himself, who is now giving glorious instructions on how to work as an undercover spy but officially heads an upscale school: English's School of Rock-esque spy academy has some fun ones Punchlines.
English, who is being promoted back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, and his former friend Bough, who has been through bad times for a long time and is again played by Ben Miller, reunite.
Now married, Bough meets a submarine commander, but Vicki Pepperdine doesn't really stand out in her cheerful, boyish part.
In chaos at Her Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister is falling under the influence of the evil Jason Volta (played by Jake Lacy), a charismatic billionaire and tech entrepreneur who claims to be able to get a grip on the UK's IT problems.
A potpourri of motley gimmicks begins: English and Bough, in waiter costumes, set a posh French restaurant on fire. You sneak aboard Volta's luxury yacht and mess everything up there. And the chaos becomes perfect when English tries to explore the inner workings of Volat's house with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In its entirety, it looks like children's television, even if this final scene is delightful and cheerful and all possibilities have certainly been exhausted.
Not exactly above average.
And as with every Johnny English film, one of the main questions I asked myself was: Why does the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson roles in which his talent really comes into its own?
The Labor Party denies having devised a plan whereby people in Britain work four days but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's Labor Party is engaged in radical considerations that British citizens only work four days a week but receive wages for five days.
The company bosses should pass on the money they save through advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to the employees by giving them an extra day off, according to the party’s request.
Employees would like to have a three-day weekend - without earning less
Allegedly, this idea goes well with the economic profile of the party that wants to bring about a change in the country from which the workers should benefit.
In order to take advantage of changing economic conditions, the move to a four-day week was accepted as an option for workers by the union congress.
A senior Labor official told the Sunday Times that a policy review was due before the end of the year.
With the four-day week the party wants to restore the economic balance in the interests of the workers; it is also consistent with their general industrial strategy. However, it will not be possible to achieve this goal overnight.
The Green Party had already promised a four-day week in its 2017 election campaign program, so the Labor Party would not be breaking new ground.
Labor is currently opposed to this plan.
"The four-day week is not part of our party's policy and we are not striving for it," said a Labor spokesman.
At the Labor Party conference last week, Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell presented details of his plans to restructure the economy with the goal of more social justice.
McDonnell said he was determined to remove power from "faceless directors" and "profiteers" at utility companies.
What the shadow chancellor is planning may also mean that the current shareholders of the water company may not get their full stake back because there could be “deductions” for apparent misconduct with a Labor government.
He also stated that there is a real intention to bring employees to the executive board and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds, with which a tenth of the equity of companies in the private sector is paid out to the employees, who receive profit distributions of a maximum of 500 pounds each year should be.
In "60 Minutes," Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
Due to the current FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final decision on his appeal to the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week. Furthermore, the question arises whether the results of the FBI investigation could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support for Kavanaugh.
In a conversation broadcast on Sunday, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the result of the investigation conducted by the FBI might even cause them to consider changing their assessment.
His fellow South Carolina professional appeared less open than Kennedy.
"Definitely," said Kennedy.
“At the beginning of the hearing, I said I had a chat with Judge Kavanaugh.
After the event, after the allegations were made, I called him and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, consistent, clear. "
There seemed to be no doubt about Graham's words.
He said, "My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and, at best, would be shaken by incredible insights."
Regarding Christine Blasey Ford, Graham added, “Dr Ford, I cannot say what exactly happened. But I can say that Brett vigorously denies the allegations. "
“None of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
The whole thing happened 36 years ago.
I can't see anything new, nothing that would change. "
"What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it succeeded in reducing poverty?"
The Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York on Saturday. A considerable number of stars appear at the music event, which is held once a year. The declared aim of the festival is just as remarkable: to put an end to global poverty.
Tens of thousands of visitors are expected at the seventh Global Citizen Festival on the Great Lawn in Central Park. They come not only to see stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also because they care about the real mission of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. This is an international interest group with the aim of combating poverty through a higher number of people who actively take action against it.
There were various tasks and "actions" that concertgoers could take part in in order to gain free entry to the event: For example, volunteer work, writing e-mails to important personalities in world politics and economy, phone calls or other meaningful contributions to the stated goal To fight poverty and draw more attention to the issue.
But what can be said about the success of Global Citizen twelve years before the set goal is to be achieved?
Can you actually soften people up and ask them to take action by giving them a free concert visit, or is it ultimately just another case of, as the saying goes, "clickivism" - when people believe that they are really making a difference when they sign a petition or petition or tweet something online?
According to Global Citizen, it has registered over 19 million measures by its own followers since 2011, which pursued a wide range of different goals.
Allegedly, these actions are said to have led to prominent figures from politics and business making commitments totaling more than 37 billion US dollars. By the year 2030, these are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At least $ 10 billion from the 390 missions and announcements made by the unit at the beginning of 2018 have already been paid out or paid for.
According to estimates by the group, the funds made available have so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
An important promise comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK community of investors and organizations whose aim is to "help children reach their full potential". After receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen, the group has agreed to donate US $ 35 million to end hunger in Rwanda.
At a live concert in London in April 2018, Tracey Ullman, Ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience: “We can do it with the help of the UK government, donors, foreign governments and global citizens, malnutrition - a social injustice - to get rid of the world entirely. "
There have also been over 5,000 campaigns in the UK aimed at improving the nutrition of mothers and children, according to the group, and so the government will use funding for Power of Nutrition to target 5 million women and children with nutritional support.
In response to the most frequently asked questions on their website, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The answer from the global citizen was: "It will take a long time and it will not be easy - every now and then we will accept setbacks and fail."
Like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid organizations before us, we will be successful because together we are strong.
This year the stars Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will be on stage at the event in New York with presenters Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Russian energy exports could be prevented by the US Navy by means of a "blockade" - Interior Minister
According to the Washington Examiner, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said that the US could "if necessary," deploy its naval forces in the Middle East to avert energy from Russia entering the markets.
According to Zinke, Russia is engaged in Syria in order to actually explore new energy markets, especially if it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government.
He noted: "In my opinion the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe".
The officials say there are several ways to deal with this.
“The US has the power to use our naval forces to guarantee that the sea routes will remain open. If necessary, we can also impose a blockade to prevent them from getting their energy to market, ”he said.
Zinke gave a speech to those present at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance - a non-profit organization that calls itself the “mouthpiece of energy consumers”.
Comparing Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, he realized that they are really the same.
He called Russia a “one-trick pony”, whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels, and said in the same breath that the use and recovery of fuels was in principle the only viable option for Iran and Russia.
We are receiving these statements at a time when the Trump administration is in the process of promoting the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe with the aim of replacing Russia, which is much cheaper for European suppliers.
For this reason, members of the Trump administration - including US President Donald Trump personally - are trying to convince Germany to discontinue the "inappropriate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, in Trump's opinion, would make Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
The 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, through which the current capacity is to be increased to 110 billion cubic meters, is to be an exclusively economic project, this has been emphatically declared by Russia several times.
If one believes the Kremlin, economic calculation is the cause of the US government's resistance to the project, which would be viewed as unfair competition.
Aleksandr Novak, the Russian energy minister, said after his talks with his American counterpart Rick Perry in Moscow in September: “We are certainly in agreement that energy must not be misused as a means of pressure and that consumers are entitled to choose their energy provider independently. "
The rejection from Germany, which was the reaction to this stance by the USA, only increased his motivation for the project.
The Federation of German Industries, Germany's leading industrial organization, has made an appeal to the USA not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Germany and Russia.
Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin: "I consider the interference of a third country in our energy supply to be very problematic."
Elizabeth Warren Will Take "Hard Look" At Running For President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Senator, said on Saturday about her entry into the race for the presidential election after the mid-term elections.
She is actually considering taking part in the run, Warren said on the sidelines of a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
According to The Hill, she said, “Women must go to Washington now and get our broken government back on track. This also includes a woman in a management position. "
When we are through November 6th, I will give serious thought to running for president.
At the city hall meeting, Warren alleged President Donald Trump that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
She noted, "I am very concerned about the impact Donald Trump is having on our democracy."
Warren was very direct in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
"Of course, an FBI investigation must take place before the vote," Warren tweeted on Friday.
According to a poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's own voters do not believe in their 2020 candidacy.
An opinion poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe found that 58% of those who said they were “likely” to vote in Massachusetts think the Senator should not run.
32% are in favor of a run like this.
38% of the respondents supported a possible race, 48% opposed it - according to the survey there was more support for a race by the former governor Deval Patrick.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont are also among the Democratic candidates who are expected to have good prospects for the 2020 elections.
According to the Associated Press, Biden's official decision can be expected by January.
As part of the Donald Trump campaign, Sarah Palin addressed Track Palin's PTSD
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
At a political event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, she told the audience: “I know what my own son suffered after he returned home, is still suffering. So I know how families struggle with the effects of PTSD and I know some of the injuries our soldiers come home with. "
It was clear to Palin that her son's arrest was the uncomfortable subject that interested everyone. She said of this and other war returnees: “When they come home, they are not exactly the same anymore. You got tougher. They are coming back and there is the question of whether there is adequate recognition for what their fellow soldiers, the Air Force and all other members of the Army have done. "
Wasilla Police Representative Dan Bennet was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska for assaulting a woman, facing a domestic violence complaint, and while drunk in possession of a gun.
18 states are challenging Washington to adopt a new asylum policy
The legal objection to the new US guideline, according to which victims are on the run from gangs or domestic violence, cannot be granted asylum, is supported by 18 states and Washington, D.C.
NBC News reports that on Friday officials from Washington’s 18 states and county issued an ex officio statement (Amicus Curiae) advocating a legal challenge to an asylum seeker.
Plaintiff's full name in the Grace v Sessions litigation, which the American Civil Liberties Union began in August against federal law, is unknown.
Her asylum application was denied by US officials on July 20, despite the fact that she said she was a victim of abuse by her partner “and the violent sons of his gang members”.
She was taken into police custody in Texas.
According to lawyers for the states in favor of Grace, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large proportion of asylum seekers in the United States come, are nations where gang crime and domestic violence are rampant.
Under the new US asylum policy, which overturned a 2014 Board of Appeal ruling on immigrants, it is no longer possible for undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum on the grounds that they are at risk of domestic violence.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new law contradicts decades of practice in state, federal and international law.
According to the Amicus Curiae, all asylum applications must be assessed under federal law in accordance with the circumstances of the respective lawsuit. Such an approach would violate this principle.
In the paper, the lawyers further argued that policies that refuse immigrants entry into the US are detrimental to the country's economy. It is more likely that such immigrants will become entrepreneurs themselves and pursue “important jobs”.
In June, Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to people fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"All people who are persecuted in their home country because of their ethnicity, religion, nationality, their affiliation to a certain social group or their political opinion have a right to asylum," said Sessions on June 11 in his statement on the law .
The right of asylum has never meant to solve all the problems that people around the world have to deal with every day - especially not those that are not even particularly serious.
The death toll in the search for survivors doubles during the desperate Palu rescue operations.
The situation became increasingly catastrophic for the survivors.
"Everyone is under tension here," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma. Their baby has a fever and together they found shelter in an evacuation center in the burned-out city of Palu.
"The dead are constantly being brought in.
Clean water is not available in sufficient quantities. "
Local residents were observed returning to their broken homes, taking away soaked personal items and trying to save whatever could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the 7.5 magnitude earthquake demulated the overcrowded hospitals.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was injured in the back and had a broken shoulder, waited outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated in the open air due to ongoing violent aftershocks.
He began to cry when he described how the strong earthquake shook his room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There wasn't enough time to go to a safe place.
"I think I was pressed into the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press.
Before it got quiet, I heard my wife's calls for help.
I don't know what happened to her and our child. "
My hope is that they are safe. "
American ambassador accuses China of "bullying" using "propaganda ads"
A week after a newspaper in China posted a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper highlighting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China alleged that Beijing was using the American press for propaganda purposes spread.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump pointed out the paid supplement to the China Daily in the Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa. This came after he accused China of meddling in the November 6th congressional elections. China denies these allegations.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's allegations that Beijing wanted to interfere in the US elections had reached a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Advertising by foreign states to promote trade is not uncommon, but the trade war between China and the US is currently threatening to get out of hand and there have already been several stages of tariffs on imported goods.
According to experts from China and the US, at an early stage of the trade war, China's retaliatory tariffs were aimed at exporters in US states like Iowa, which are home to many supporters of Trump's Republican Party.
Beijing has injured American workers, farmers and businesses, according to US Ambassador to China and former long-time governor of the state of Iowa Terry Brandstad. Brandstad itself is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China, Branstand said in a comment on Sunday's Des Moines Register, “is now vigorously engaging in this bullying through propaganda in our own free press.
"By placing propaganda as paid advertising in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is exploiting the valued American tradition of free speech and free press," said Branstad.
"If you consider that the media is in the stranglehold of the Chinese Communist Party, you will only find a very limited number of other perspectives at a newspaper stand in the streets of Beijing, and certainly no representation of the different views that the people of China have on have serious economic development in their country, ”he wrote.
He said that “one of the leading Chinese newspapers declined an offer to publish,” but he did not tell which newspaper it was.
Analysts point to the danger that the Republican Party will annoy the female electorate through the Kavanaugh fiasco ahead of the mid-term elections.
Many Republican Party leaders support Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for Supreme Court election, despite charges of sexual abuse. In this regard, analysts warn that they could be punished for this in the next elections, especially by women,
Feelings were boiling over, the majority of Republicans had already indicated that they intended to vote for him.
In an article in The Hill on Saturday, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, noted that these things cannot be restored.
Reeher's view is that the last-minute support for the FBI investigation demonstrated by Jeff Flake (Republican MP for the state of Arizona) may not be enough to reconcile disgruntled voters.
"No woman will forget what happened yesterday - not tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, leading advisor and spokeswoman for the politically progressive association MoveOn, on Friday, according to a Washington newspaper.
According to Mic reports, “November is Coming!” Was sung in the hallway of the Senate Friday morning during the protest, while the majority Republican Judiciary Committee decided to end the Kavanaugh nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford uphold.
Neutral political analyst Stu Rothenberg told reporters that the democratic enthusiasm and drive will be endless.
“Right, it is said that it is quite advanced.
Especially among the female electorate from the suburbs, who do not always vote for the same party, as well as the younger female electorate between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not cast their vote even though they have no sympathy for the president, is with this party There is room for improvement. "
In the run-up to Ford's public testimony of sexual violence against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts commented that there could be a defensive reaction should the Republican Party pursue the nomination.
Former Republican National Committee President Michael Steele said the matter had become a mess for the GOP, according to NBC News.
“This is not just about the committee election, the final election, or whether or not Kavanaugh is replaced. It's about how the Republicans handled the situation, ”Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the Democrats in these elections, told the news channel.
However, the Americans disagree on what Ford and Kavanaugh said.
According to a new YouGov poll, 41 percent of respondents believed the Ford testimony was certain or likely, and 35 percent believed Kavanaugh certain or likely.
Also, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or certain to have lied about his statement, while only 30 percent of Ford believed so.
According to a report by The Guardian, the allegations of Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, are currently being investigated by the FBI, and this is being done at the instigation of Flake.
Ford was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17. She testified this under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.
The judge's candidate is said to have exposed his penis in front of Ramirez at a student party in Yale in the 1980s.
Challenge to Google and Facebook: the inventor of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet
The new rival of Facebook, Amazon and Google is the start-up company of Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet.
Inrupt, the current endeavor of the technology icon, is based on "Solid", the open source platform from Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users are able to determine the location of their data and who is given access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee quipped that Inrupt's aim was to take over universal rule.
"We have to act now," he said of the startup.
"This is a moment of historical importance."
With the application, which is based on Solid technologies, users can create individual online storage for their data or a POD.
The data store can contain lists of contacts and tasks, calendars, music playlists and other personal and professional tools.
Everything is combined in one browser and can be accessed at the same time, such as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
One of the special features of the individual online data storage is that the user can decide for himself who is allowed to access which type of information.
The group speaks of empowering people through data.
According to company CEO John Bruce, Inrupt provides resources, processes and relevant expertise to make Solid accessible to a broad user base.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a number of people involved in the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools offered on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee explained that neither his team nor he would discuss the far-reaching adjustments, which are intended to fundamentally change all known functions of companies from one day to the next, with Facebook and Google.
"We will not ask you to give us your permission."
"Inrit's mission is to provide competitive energy and an ecosystem that can protect the integrity and quality of a new solid-based Internet," said Berners-Lee in an article on Medium published on Saturday has been.
When Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994, it was a complete transformation of the Internet.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has had a major impact on the discussion about net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will retain his positions as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute during the start-up phase of Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said he was extremely positive about the coming phase of the internet.
Bernard Vann: Winner of the Victoria Cross, clergyman and soldier of the First World War receives an honor
100 years after the only priest in the Church of England was awarded a Victoria Cross as a soldier in World War I, he was celebrated in his hometown.
The Lieutenant Colonel and Anglican Pastor Bernard Vann received the medal for the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
But four days later he fell victim to a sniper and was never told that he had been awarded the highest military medal.
His two grandchildren dedicated a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamtonshire on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of the man's grandchildren, explained that it was “of astonishing symbolism” that the stone was given to the public exactly one century after his grandfather's prank.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann and his company crossed the Saint-Quentin Canal in September 1918 “in extremely thick fog and heavy artillery and machine gun fire”.
Then he rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward with "the greatest elegance" before he pulled his field pistol with one hand and pulled the trigger three times.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann called his grandfather's actions "something that I know I could never do justice and that fills me with humility."
Following the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, he and Dr. James Vann, his brother, took off a wreath.
"The approval received from countless people reflects the courage of a true idol," added Michael Vann, who was honored to be involved in the parade.
MMA fans went all night to see Bellator 206 but only got Peppa Pig
You need to realize that you haven't slept all night to watch the full Bellator 2016 event just to miss the main event.
Thirteen fights were scheduled in San Jose, including six main fights. These were broadcast live on Channel 5 at night in the UK.
At 6 a.m., the television audience had to sit and watch while the show Peppa Pig was being faded in just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their duel.
Some who had gone without sleep for most of the night just for battle were not impressed.
On Twitter, a fan describes the switch to children's cartoon as a "disturbed joke".
“According to government regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6:00 am, so it had to switch to children's programs,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked for a comment after the broadcast.
"Yes," "Peppa the pig."
Scott Coker, executive director of Bellator, said they were working on a plan for the future that would take viewers in the UK into account.
"When I think about the repetition now, I assume that we will manage it," said Cocker.
“We can only solve the problem on Sunday our time, that is, Monday of your time, because it is now six o'clock on Sunday morning.
But we keep trying.
None of the many written comments after the switch was nice, I assure you.
We thought it was a technical error and looked for a way to repair it.
The difficulty was on the government side, but that was not critical.
What I can promise you is that this won't happen again.
We will reduce the number of fights from six to five - as is usual. We worked hard for the fans and just did it.
The location is not favorable. "
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley experienced feelings of inferiority because of his sexual orientation.
Because of his sexual orientation, Olympic diver Tom Daley had felt at a disadvantage all his life. However, it was exactly that which gave him the fighting spirit that ultimately made him successful.
It was only at secondary school that the 24-year-old realized that “he is not like everyone else”.
Because he wanted to give other people "confidence", he had spoken in public about the rights of people with same-sex orientation, he said in the premiere broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne.
He added that an Olympic victory after the birth of his child would have lost its meaning for him.
Kristy Young, the actual presenter of the long-aired show, has called in sick for several months.
Daley had his appearance in Laverne's first program and said that "since society cannot accept it if someone is bisexual", he felt "more worthless" than the others as a teenager.
He explained: "The feeling that I am less valuable, that I am different, is what motivates me to this day and gives me the perseverance that I need for my success."
His intention was to prove that he was not "nobody" and that he did not want to disappoint anyone by revealing his sexual identity.
Today the double bronze medalist is a major LGBT activist. He used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia for a call for the international decriminalization of homosexuality.
He spoke up because he was lucky enough to be allowed to live an open life free of negative consequences and because he wanted to "encourage" other people.
According to his own account, the three-time world champion fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. This surprised him very much.
Last year, Daley and the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, got married. The age difference never caused the two problems.
“If you already experienced so much as a young person” - he first competed in the Olympic Games when he was 14, when he was 17, his father died of cancer - it would have been difficult to find people of the same age who had similar positive and negative experiences later have made.
The couple's son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, was born in June. Daley said this changed his “whole perspective”.
He said that for him last year it was all about getting gold.
“Well, you know, a gold medal at the Olympics isn't the most important thing.
My gold medal is called Robbie. "
His father Robert, whose name his son now bears, died in 2011 at the age of only 40 after being diagnosed with cancer.
Daley remembered that his father would not accept his imminent death and that at the very end he asked about the tickets for London 1212 - because he wanted to be in the front.
He said: "I was not able to explain to him: 'Dad, you will never see sitting in the front row again." "
“Even when his breathing failed, I kept holding his hand. It wasn't until he couldn't breathe at all and was lying lifeless that I realized he'd lost the fight, ”he said.
The following year, 2012, Daley won Olympic bronze.
He explained, “It was a lifelong dream of mine. There is no better feeling than jumping into the water in front of domestic spectators at the Olympic Games. "
That is also reflected in the song he chose - Proud by Heather Small. He heard this song while training for the Olympic Games and it still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 am BST.
Mickelson had to sit weak on the bench on Saturday of the Ryder Cup.
On Sunday the American Phil Mickelson will play his 47th Ryder Cup game and set a new record, but he has to play much better so that this important moment does not turn into a tragedy.
Captain Jim Furyk put Mickelson, who is participating in the two-year event for the twelfth time, on the bench for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
The five-time major winner did not spend his day in the limelight for the US, as one might have expected, but hoped to put his lows behind him by cheering on and practice rounds on the golf course.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not a particularly straight driver and is extremely unsuitable for the narrow Le Golf National course, whose long rough regularly punishes failures.
Mickelson's challenge in the ninth match on Sunday not only consists of the pitch, but also of British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who is known for the accuracy of his strokes and who emerged as the winner of all four matches together with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood during the week .
Mickelson's match could decide everything if the Americans catch up four points at the beginning of the 12 individual games and have a hot start.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband - there was hardly any other option.
Furyk explained: "His role today was perfectly clear to him, he gave me a clap on the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow".
“He's very confident.
This week, as in previous years, this Hall of Fame member has done great things for these teams.
I wouldn't have expected him to play two games.
I had hoped for more from it, but that's how it turned out and that's how we think we have to go about it.
He just wants to go outside like the others.
The previous record holder for the largest number of Ryder Cup matches played, Nick Faldo, will be replaced by Mickelson on Sunday.
A Ryder Cup career that never quite kept up with his personal accomplishments could end there.
Mickelson's presence was incredibly valuable for the team, Furyk said despite his record of 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws.
He said: "He's funny, sarcastic, funny, a real entertainer and a great person, and I like having him on the team."
I got the impression that it was a special experience for the younger players to play against him. That was a beautiful sight. "
It has a lot more to offer than just the game. "
The European captain Thomas Bjorn is aware that the big lead could only be temporary.
Team Europe captain Thomas Bjorn already knows the situation of going into the singles with an advantage of several strokes on the final day of the Ryder Cup and knows that it can be tough.
In 1997 the man from Denmark made his debut in the game in Valderrama, in which the team of coach Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of Team USA, but narrowly reached the goal and won by a tiny margin of 14.5 to 13.5.
After being a spectator on Friday and yesterday at the 5-3 success of the Class of 2018, which was now leading 10: 6 at Le Golf National, Bjorn said that they hadn't forgotten that they were ahead in Valderrama had that they had gambled away the victory in Brookline, even though they were well in the lead and that in Valderrama they could only win with a wafer-thin difference.
History will show me and all the members of this team that things will continue.
Tomorrow you will be completely bored.
Go out there and do the right thing.
Once the dots appear on the board, it's over.
We are focusing on our goal of winning this trophy.
After all, we are facing a powerful opponent, the world's best experts in this sport, but I am completely convinced of the twelve players in our team, those have always been my words. "
Björn was visibly impressed by the skills of his players on the demanding golf course and added: “I would never be hasty here.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, when the personal performances come, it will be a very different matter.
When you have a partner and everything is going according to plan, it's fun out there. However, if you are alone on the course, you really have to prove your own golf skills.
That's what you have to give the players on the way: to give their best again the next day.
At this point you pass it on to your partner and he has to give it his all. "
The goal of Jim Furyk, unlike his competitor Björn, will be a better performance of his players in singles compared to doubles. The only exception are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have secured three out of four points.
For Furyk, it is not the first incredible turn on a final day of the game that he has experienced. However, at the time he was on the winners' side with Brookline, this time his team is inferior to the Europeans in the “Miracle of Medinah”.
"I still have every single damn word in my head," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, who was team captain in 1999, had called his team together at the beginning of the last day of the game.
Tomorrow there are 12 crucial games, but you want to start as soon as possible, as was seen in Brookline, in Medinah.
Once a momentum of its own has developed, this leads to a high load in the middle matches.
Our line-up is well planned and we let our boys play the way we felt, you know, we really want to deliver a top performance tomorrow.
In this important game, Thomas was to face Rory McIlroy along with Europeans Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are also at the top of the rankings.
I opted for this line-up because I believe that we have prepared for any eventualities, ”explains Bjorn about his individual selection.
Schedule for new German warship is postponed again
Actually, the newest frigate of the German Navy, which is supposed to replace obsolete warships from the Cold War era, should have been used in 2014. According to the German press, however, the deployment can be postponed until next year or more. The cause is faulty systems and unmanageable costs.
According to the time that refers to a spokesman for the German armed forces, the commissioning of the "Rhineland-Palatinate" is to be delayed until the first half of 2019. It is the lead ship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class.
The German Navy was supposed to put the ships into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was overshadowed by serious difficulties after the first delivery.
The four Baden-Württemberg class frigates that the Navy ordered in 2007 are replacing the older Bremen-class ships.
It can be assumed that they have an efficient cannon, multiple missiles to defend themselves against aircraft and ships, and stealth technology such as lower radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
The innovative frigates should be able to be used for up to 24 months without a stay in the home port - the increased time between stops for maintenance is another significant plus.
The weekly newspaper “Die Zeit” writes that the constant delays would mean that the state-of-the-art warships, with which power projection should be possible in distant foreign countries, would already be out of date when they finally started their activities.
The frigate F125, repeatedly plagued by technical problems, made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It has never happened before that the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Apart from several dangerous "software and hardware errors" cited in German media that would render the warship incapable of fighting during an operation, little was known about why the ships were being returned.
Software deficiencies also played a special role, because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class were operated by a crew of only around 120 people - older frigates of the Bremen class employed twice as many seafarers.
The ship was also found to be very overweight, which would lead to performance degradation and make upgrades more difficult for the Navy in the future.
According to estimates, the “Rhineland-Palatinate” weighs 7,000 tons, twice as much as ships of the same class that were in service on the German side during World War II.
Not only the defective hardware, but also the price of the entire project - including training of the crew - is discussed.
In the meantime, the costs have apparently risen to a staggering 3.1 billion euros (approx. 3.6 billion US dollars) - in contrast to the 2.2 billion euros that were actually planned.
If you consider the latest voices warning that Germany is becoming less and less important as a military sea power, the problems with the new frigates are even more serious.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Defense Committee of the Bundestag, made the admission at the beginning of the year that the Navy “had fewer and fewer ships ready for action”.
The fact that obsolete ships were decommissioned without adequate replacement has increased the problem over time, the incumbent said.
He complained that the Navy had not put any of the Baden-Württemberg class ships into service.
The National Trust listens to the bats' hidden habitat.
Current research in a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to investigate the form in which bats use their environment to help them hunt for food.
It is hoped that this will enable them to learn more about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and to use the knowledge as a basis for future animal welfare measures.
For their study, the researchers from the National Trust for Scotland want to observe the common vampire, the mosquito bat, the brown long-eared bat and the water bat in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be set up at the most important points of the accommodation in order to be able to observe the activities of the bats throughout the entire season.
NHA staff and volunteers will also conduct surveys for mobile devices with handheld detectors.
Using a special audio analysis, the frequency of bat calls can be determined and the calls assigned to different species.
It is safe to assume that the future habitat map and report will provide a detailed summary of behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), wants to research more precisely which areas of the habitat are of particular importance for the bats and how the different species use them.
These data can be used to examine the benefits of habitat management, such as meadow formation, and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats has decimated severely over the past century in Scotland and across the UK.
Construction work poses a threat to their sleeping places and their living space.
Danger can also come from flycatcher strips and from building materials processed with chemicals or from wind turbines and light sources; even attacks from domestic cats are a factor.
Strictly speaking, bats are not at all visually impaired.
In the activities of night hunting, their ears, which are precisely tuned, are more helpful than their eyes.
Complex technology for echo location enables them to identify the location of errors and obstacles on the flight route.
The bats are a key responsibility for the NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide.
Ten trained experts, who do surveys at regular intervals, examine the sleeping places and occasionally go on rescue missions.
The first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland, located on the Threade estate in Dumfries and Galloway and home to eight out of ten native bat species, was also established by the organization.
The property manager David Thompson considers the optimal living space:
"Here in Threave we have a good habitat for bats."
“The old houses, numerous old trees and the entire good biotope are in our possession.
But bats have not yet been thoroughly researched and our work here and at other locations helps us to better understand what is vital for them. "
It is important to him that buildings should be checked for bats prior to maintenance. If a mother's roost is accidentally destroyed, up to 400 females and young animals can lose their lives - and potentially wipe out an entire population.
Bats are protected species. Killing, harassing or disturbing them and destroying their sleeping quarters is prohibited.
A call for help from the public comes from the Scot Elisabeth Ferrell of the Bat Conservation Trust.
“There is a lot about our bats that we don't know yet. We don't have any information about the way their populations are built for many species, ”she explained.
Lawyers are suing the German magazine, while Ronaldo denies rape claims
By associating his name with hers, people wanted to “make themselves important”, said Cristiano Ronaldo, who denounced the demands made against him in connection with rape allegations as “fake news”.
His defense lawyers will take legal action against the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which made the allegations public.
In 2009, the Portuguese attacker from Juventus allegedly sexually abused an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
Then he is said to have given her $ 375.00 to keep her silent about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Only hours after the first report, the 33-year-old Ronaldo denied the reports in an Instagram live video as "fake news" to his 142 million followers.
Certainly not, absolutely not. No.
During the interview, the five-time world footballer said that what was just told was "fake news".
“You want to use my name for self-promotion.
“That is common.
You want to attract attention with my name, but that's part of the job.
With a grin on his face, the player added that he was happy and all was well.
After these allegations, Ronaldo's lawyers are working on a lawsuit against the magazine "Der Spiegel". According to Reuters, they are accused of "improper reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy".
According to the lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will claim damages for "immaterial damage according to the severity of the injury", which is "probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
A suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas is said to have been the scene of the event in June 2009.
Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's room in a nightclub after they met. There he forced her to have anal sex against her will, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in the US state of Nevada.
According to Mayorga, Ronaldo got on his knees after the incident and told her that he was "99 percent good" and that "one percent" made a mistake of him.
The records indicate that Ronald confirmed the couple's sex, but it is said to have been consensual.
Mayorga said she went to the police and a hospital, where she had her injuries documented with photos. Nevertheless, she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement - out of "fear of retaliation" and because she feared that she would otherwise have to expect "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old is striving to have the agreement declared invalid because she suffered a trauma as a result of the alleged occurrence.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, this summer he moved to the Italian football giant Juve with a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: The UK will forever feel sorry for automakers to leave
"A loss of position as the international market leader in the automotive industry through Brexit would be unforgivable for the British," said Economics Minister Greg Clark.
Toyota's statement to the BBC that production at the Burnaston facility near Derby would be halted for a while if Britain were to leave the EU without an agreement was a "cause for concern," he added.
“An agreement is urgently needed,” said Clark.
The fear of the Japanese automobile company is that a no-deal Brexit and the associated delays at the borders would lead to the loss of jobs.
Almost 150,000 vehicles, nine tenths of which were exported to the rest of the European Union, were built last year at the Burnaston facility, where the Auris and Avensis models are produced for Toyota.
“If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March without a Brexit agreement, I believe that production will be interrupted at our plants,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota in Burnaston.
With a view to the possibility of leaving the EU without negotiating the terms of an exchange of goods across borders, some British vehicle manufacturers, including a. Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have filed concerns.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will not open its branch in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concern about supply chain problems is what automakers predict in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing facilities operate on an on-demand basis. This means that the material is brought in every 37 minutes by suppliers in the UK and the EU for special production.
A no-deal Brexit on March 29 could result in significant waiting times at the border. Economic experts fear delivery bottlenecks and failures.
Production at the Derbyshire plant would be shut down as it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain it for more than another day, the company said.
According to Clark, Theresa May's plan for future European relations is based on "precise considerations so that no such border controls would arise."
On BBC Radio 4's Today program, he said: “We need a deal. We want the optimal deal with which we can secure our current success and we would like to take this opportunity too ”.
"Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers say that an unrestricted continuation of the supply chains, which we are currently using very successfully, must be guaranteed."
The rising costs could be at the expense of the competitiveness of the location and lead to job cuts there, warned Toyota, but did not provide any more detailed information on a possible duration of the production interruption.
"Once jobs have been deleted, experience shows that they never come back," said the employee's organization representative, Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, referring to the growing concern among members of the workers' organization.
"We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU," said a government spokesman.
According to the White House, the date for the meeting of Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again.
At the important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, "another week of delay" may be expected, because, as the White House announced on Sunday, the negotiations over Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court will continue.
Rosenstein supervises the activities of the special advisor Robert Mueller. This examines the connections between Trump and Russia and investigates a potential legal obstruction by the president.
The question of whether Trump would now dismiss the deputy minister of justice and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has repeatedly sparked discussions in Washington over the past few months.
According to an article in the New York Times earlier this month, Rosenstein had considered wearing a cord to record his conversations with Trump, making it possible to remove the president from office under the 15th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein was not prepared to comment.
He went to the White House last Monday amid numerous reports that he was about to resign.
It was announced that a meeting would take place on Thursday instead with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in Ney York.
According to his own statement, Trump prefers not to fire Rosenstein. However, the meeting was postponed afterwards so that there was no overlap with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In this testimony both Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week on Friday, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Donald Trump's press secretary, was on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “There is no official date yet, it may take place this week. It may be postponed for another week as there are many more issues pending in the Supreme Court right now.
We will just keep looking and I will keep the press informed. "
Since September 10, Sanders has not hosted a media meeting at the official US seat of government - a finding some journalists would deny.
The invited Chris Wallace wanted to know the reason for this.
According to Sanders, the reason for the lack of preliminary talks is not an antipathy towards TV reporters who are only interested in self-portrayal. But she also added: "If you like, you can stand in the stands."
She then recommended more direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president does more question-and-answer rounds than all the presidents before him," she claimed and without proving anything, she added: "The numbers speak for themselves."
According to Sanders, there will continue to be briefings, but if the members of the press are given the opportunity to put questions directly to the US president, this is much preferable.
You saw that we have done a lot in the past few weeks and that we are trying very hard. If you speak to the President of the USA yourself, a press conference will no longer be necessary. "
Trump always asks questions when attending public conversations or press conferences with guest dignitaries or when leaving the White House.
There are practically never press conferences with only one participant.
One possible reason became apparent when the president appeared before the press in New York this week. This seemed carefree and sometimes bizarre.
Concerns about Brexit: EU workers at NHS Scotland receive letters from the Minister of Health
In a letter to EU staff in Scotland's NHS, the Minister of Health expressed her gratitude and the wish that they stay after the UK leaves the EU.
Jane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, drafted her letter less than 6 months before Brexit.
The agreed status applications for EU citizens who work decentrally as civil servants for the Scottish government, they say they want to finance themselves.
The wording in Ms Freeman's document read as follows: “Talks between the UK and the EU on the exit continued in the summer months pending the decisions to be taken in autumn.
The government of Great Britain is now also working more intensively on preparations for a possible exit without an agreement.
I can imagine that this is an oppressive time for all of you.
I therefore emphasize once again that I would very much appreciate the cooperation of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
The important knowledge and talents that our professionals from the EU and other countries bring in consolidate and increase the quality of our health system and thus also serve the patients and groups we care for.
We don't want you to go - you are at home in Scotland. "
Christion Abercrombie has to undergo emergency surgery following his head injury
After Christion Abercrombie, defender for the Tennessee State Tigers, suffered a head injury on Saturday in the game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, which the opposing team won 31:27, emergency surgery had to be performed.
The Tennessee State University team coach told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
Reed remarked, "When he reached the sideline, he sank to the ground there."
Abercrombie was taken care of on the sidelines by the coach and medical assistants before being taken away on a stretcher for additional examination.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was through surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said that "the nature and severity of the injuries are not yet known" and that the Tennessee police are currently trying to determine when he was injured.
After being transferred from Illinois, Abercrombie, a red shirt in its second season, is playing his debut season with Tennessee State.
By the time he left the pitch in the game on Saturday, he had five tackles, bringing him to a total of 18 tackles in the season so far.
Foreign buyers must pay higher stamp duty to buy property in the UK.
If a person from abroad buys a property in the UK and uses the additional money available to support people without a home in the course of new projects of the Tory party, the rate of the stamp duty to be paid by that person increases.
This should counteract Corbyn's concern to get young voters excited about himself.
Those who do not pay tax in the UK will have to pay stamp duty.
With the expected additional income of up to 120 million pounds per year, the Treasury wants to expand the homeless.
A higher stamp duty is levied on foreigners buying property in the UK. The money thus gained should benefit the homeless, says Theresa May today.
Many see this move as an attempt to undo Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters by promising affordable housing and higher wages.
The stamp duty is payable by individuals and businesses that do not pay UK tax. The government would like to use the resulting additional income in the fight against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is levied in addition to the current stamp tax (including the higher rates for second homes and rented apartments, introduced two years ago) may be up to 3 percent.
The Treasury Department is assuming an additional revenue of £ 120 million annually.
For first-time buyers, buying property is made more difficult by the fact that approximately 13% of newly completed buildings in London are bought by people outside of the UK, which increases purchase prices.
Many financially well-off cities in the country, and especially the capital, have become “ghost towns” in which the houses belong to foreigners who do not live in them most of the time.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty reduction. This is intended to support young people in buying their first home.
In addition to his appeal to Ms. May to withdraw the stipulated share for affordable apartments and thereby put an end to the deficit on the housing market in Great Britain, he accused the major construction companies, through their strategy of buying building space at a low price, without subsequently doing so to build, to keep real estate expensive.
Corbyn made announcements for various reforms in the housing sector, including fixed rental prices and the ban on no-fault evictions.
He would also like to grant the committees further authorizations for the construction of new buildings.
"Last year I talked about using my term as Prime Minister to breathe new life into the British dream - that it should be better for every generation," May said.
That means that we have to bring our destroyed housing market back into shape.
Britain will always have a place for people who live here, go to work and want to make a living.
However, it cannot be that foreign companies and non-UK residents can purchase homes as easily as hard-working UK citizens.
The longing to own a home is not only unreachable for most people, the pride-gnawing feeling of homelessness is a real danger.
"My ultimate goal is to be Scotland's manager," said Jack Ross.
The current manager of Sunderland, Jack Ross, said that it was his dream to one day be manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old from Scotland is excited about the challenge of bringing the club from the North East back to the top. At the moment he is in third place in the first division, three points behind first place.
After last year's promotion to the first division of Scotland with St. Mirren, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
"I wanted to play as a representative of my country."
A B-cap was all I got, ”explained Ross on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“The memory of seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child has always drawn me back here.
"However, this possibility would only arise if I succeed in club management."
The previous coaches Ross ‘at Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he wouldn't be afraid to follow in the footsteps of such veteran managers at a club of this size. He had already rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town in advance.
"For me, success is currently related to the question" Will I be able to get back into the Premier League with this club? ""
"The structure and organization of this club are undoubtedly worthy of the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to achieve that, but I will probably only speak of a success if I can get the club back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years. Prior to that, he was assistant coach at Dumbarton and coached at Hearts for 15 months.
After the only narrow rescue before relegation, he made St. Mirren champion in the following season, after he had supported Alloa in regenerating from relegation to the third division.
Ross noted that in his entire career as a player, whether at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren or Hamilton Academical, he has never felt as comfortable as he is now.
"You could call it the right turning point," he muses about how he took over the management position in Alloa.
“I was convinced that I am even better suited to being a manager than a player.
Since I played well, earned decently and had many great moments, this may sound a little strange.
Life can be exhausting for a player.
You have to endure some things every week.
I feel good in management, even when tension and pressure keep recurring.
Becoming a manager has always been a small dream for me, and now I can make it come true. Since I've grown up, nothing has ever felt so right to me. "
On Sunday, September 30th, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Radio Scotland you can watch the whole sport sound talk.
According to a survey, Saturdays at 5:30 p.m. is the perfect time to drink beer.
The battered British pubs saw their revenues grow thanks to the high summer temperatures, but the restaurant chains are under more pressure.
The group of pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July - however, restaurants recorded a lower sales of 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, management consultant at CGA, who compiled the statistics, explained: “Because it was a long summer and England did better than expected at the World Cup, the situation in July was similar to the previous June, when the Pub visits increased 2.8 percent. This time, however, this trend was even more evident in the eateries.
After the catering industry had to record losses of 1.8 percent in June, the situation deteriorated even further in July.
Pubs and bars selling beverages were clearly the best performers, with like-for-like numbers rising more than restaurants falling.
The sun was also negative for the pubs, which mainly focus on food, if not quite as bad as for the restaurant owners.
Apparently the people just wanted to go for a drink.
The managed pubs and bars recorded an increase in sales for drinks of 6.6 percent this month, while sales for food fell by three percent. "
"The trend that has been evident since the end of April continues with these results," said Paul Newman, one of the RSM analysts for the leisure and hospitality sector.
The most critical factors driving out-of-home sales continue to be the weather and major social and sporting events.
The situation of the restaurant groups is still difficult, which is not surprising, although a minus of 4.8% in the value of the services provided compared to last year is likely to hit particularly hard if the cost situation remains tense.
This long and very warm summer hits food companies particularly hard. Only time will tell if the lower temperatures of August will make for a much-needed break.
The gradual market entry of new brands is also reflected in the total increase in sales of 2.7% in July for pubs and restaurants, including new openings.
Coffer Peach's industry-established Business Tracker is a data collection and analysis tool that monitors the performance of 47 operational groups with total sales in excess of £ 9 billion.
Every fifth child has accounts in social networks that they keep secret from their parents.
According to a survey, every fifth child - some of them are just 11 years old - has secret profiles on social networks that parents and teachers do not know about.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students shows that the number of fake profiles on Instagram is on the rise.
Concerns about the possibility of posting sexual content were increased by this announcement.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a master account. so that they could show this to their parents.
20 percent of children - some of them just 11 years old - have social media accounts that adults are not allowed to find out about.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found that fake profiles on Instagram are on the rise - a link to the Instagram website, where users can share their photos.
The presumption that it could have been posts with sexual content was supported by this communication.
Of the participating schoolchildren, 20 percent stated that they had a “toned-down” main account for their parents in addition to other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon a secret bank account held by her 13-year-old daughter discovered a minor calling on others to “rape me”.
According to studies by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of School Directors (HMC) of independent schools, 40 percent of 11 to 18 year-old students should have two accounts. Half of the respondents admitted to having non-public profiles.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the Headmasters 'and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), said, “I am concerned that so many young people seem to be tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them can withstand. "
Eilidh Doyle is the "voice of the athletes" on the board of directors of Scottish Athletics.
As a non-executive member, Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the board at the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Doyle is one of the Scottish athletes with the most athletic awards. According to Chairman Ian Beattie, the move represents an excellent opportunity for the sport's leaders to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past 10 years.
Beattie stated, "Eilidh has a tremendous reputation in the Scottish, British and global athletics federations and we believe it would be good for the sport in Scotland if she joined the governing body."
She is full of anticipation to be able to speak for the athletes and full of hope that her contribution will help Scottish sport, said Doyle.
The American, who won two of his four gold medals at the 200 and 400 meter Olympics in Atlanta and is a regular commentator for the BBC today, was temporarily unable to walk after suffering an ischemic stroke.
His comment on Twitter: “Exactly a month ago I had a stroke.
I was unable to move.
According to the doctors' statements, after a while you will see whether and how much I will recover.
It was not an easy path, but in the end there was a full recovery, walking could be relearned and today he / she did agility exercises.
Many thanks for the encouraging words! "
Advertisements for breast pumps, in which comparisons are made between mums and cows, are causing heated discussions on the Internet.
A breast pump manufacturer has been the subject of online debates over an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milk cows being milked.
The "world's first completely quiet, portable breast pump" comes onto the market. With its ironic music video-style commercial, consumer tech company Elvie wants to demonstrate the freedom mothers can enjoy thanks to the new pump.
In a barn, four mothers, surrounded by cows, dance to a song that says, among other things: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "Just to be clear, these are my breasts, not udders."
"Draw, draw, I take care of the babies, draw, draw, I take the milk from my ladies," is the continuation of the slogan.
However, the advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the internet.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The reactions of the audience are mixed - many say that the "horrors" of the dairy industry become clear here.
"It is a very bad idea to use cows to promote this product."
Like us, they too have to get pregnant and have children in order to give milk. The only difference is that their babies are taken away a few days after they are born, ”someone said.
The Elvie breast pump can be stowed inconspicuously in a bra for breastfeeding (Elvie / mother).
"This is of course a traumatic experience for the mother and the child," says another.
Of course, why shouldn't we use it to promote breast pumps for mothers who don't have to give up their babies?
"What an outsider advertisement," added someone else.
However, the advertising also has defenders, for example a woman who admits that she thinks the song is “totally funny”.
I think that's a great idea.
If I had still breastfed I would have received one.
I felt absolutely like a cow pumping.
The advertising was a little strange, but I accepted it for what it was.
This article is just awesome, ”someone wrote.
Another woman commented: "For mothers who often feel like 'cows' when pumping at work or in the toilet, the advertisement is funny."
This is not an advertisement that is supposed to endorse or criticize the dairy industry. "
The group of women in the video reveals at the end that they all had the inconspicuous pumps in their bras while dancing.
The starting point of the campaign is the statement of many mothers that they feel like cows when they express milk.
With the Elvie Pump, women can move around freely, take their babies in their arms and even go out while pumping because it is absolutely noiseless, has no cables or tubes and can be placed inconspicuously in a nursing bra.
Comment from Ana Balarin, Partner and ECE at Mother: “The Elvie pump is a truly revolutionary product that needs to be brave and provocative on the market.
By comparing women with dairy cows, we wanted to put breast pumps and all of the challenges that come with them at the center of attention. At the same time, we wanted to show in a funny and understandable way the incredible feeling of freedom the new pump offers.
This is not the first time Elvie Pump has hit the headlines
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski and demonstrated the use of the product.
Hundreds of underage immigrants tacitly moved into a tent camp near the Texas border.
The search for donors for children with a migrant background was in part made more difficult by the rough choice of words of the Trump administration, which is why more children were arrested despite the relatively constant number of children crossing the border each month.
If you support a child, you run the risk of being deported, as most of the donors used to be illegal migrants themselves.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members would be required to have their fingerprints taken and that this information would be passed on to immigration authorities.
According to Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement officer, last week, the agency arranged dozens of arrests of people who volunteered to help unaccompanied children and young people.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous convictions.
“Almost 80 percent of those who are either donors or belong to the households of donors reside illegally in this country. A significant proportion of them are criminal illegal immigrants.
"So we will continue to be after these people," said Albence.
The officials created new rules that aimed at faster processing of applications for the children. As a result of this, some of them should appear in court within one month of their imprisonment, instead of the previous 60 days, explains the accommodation staff.
For their application for a residence permit, many do not appear in person, but rather by video conference call before the immigration court.
Those who do not qualify for discharge can expect a quick deportation.
The longer children are in detention, the greater the likelihood that they will develop anxiety or become depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Advocates say that these doubts are compounded in a larger facility like Tornillo, where the size makes it more likely that signals that a child is struggling are ignored.
In addition, they said that children who have to move to the tent city without enough time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends could suffer even more from a trauma that many already have.
The Syrian side requested the American, French and Turkish "occupiers" to withdraw immediately
Before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem issued a call to return home to Syrian refugees, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
There will be "appropriate handling" of foreign troops whose stationing in Syrian areas on the pretense that the terrorism problem will be countered with military means is illegal, said Muoalem, who is also deputy prime minister.
"Immediate, unconditional withdrawal is necessary," he told the congregation.
Moualem insisted that “the end of the war on terror is in sight” in Syria. Since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths in the country and many millions more have been affected by displacement from their homes.
Only when the two terrorist organizations and "all illegal occupation troops from abroad have been expelled from all areas of Syria" will Syria continue this holy struggle, he said.
The United States of America has approximately 2,000 soldiers on Syrian territory. First and foremost, they train and advise Kurdish militias and Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French ground soldiers were deployed in the war-ravaged country.
When asked about the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for return were acceptable and accused some countries of "creating unreasonable fears" that made refugees shy away from returning.
Moualem said: “We have asked the international community as well as humanitarian agencies to make return easier.
"Strictly speaking, an exclusively humanitarian matter is turned into a political issue by them."
The US and the EU pointed out that reconstruction aid for Syria was linked to an agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the establishment of a buffer zone on the site of the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, as recently agreed by Russia and Turkey, could help bring about political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops on the province, where three million people live. The Syrian government troops are supported by Russia.
Moualem underlined, however, that the agreement included "clear deadlines". It is his hope that the military operation will concentrate on the jihadists, including the "extermination" of the warriors of the Nusra Front who have a connection with al-Qaeda.
A new committee made up of representatives from the government and the opposition is expected to meet shortly to prepare a draft for a possible Syrian post-war constitution and thus initiate the first step towards an election - at least that is the hope of UN envoy Staffan de Mistura.
The Syrian government had set conditions for their participation in the panel, which Moualem put forward. The work of the committee should not go beyond “to examine the articles of the current constitution”, everything else will not be tolerated.
That's why Trump wins a second term
If impeachment proceedings and affairs do not lead to an early end to the presidency, as many liberal viewers presumably hope, then thanks to this logic Mr Trump will win the 2020 election again.
The result would certainly be "the end of a presidency that is unparalleled in terms of drama"!
There is currently no sign of the audience getting tired.
There have been more than twice as many prime time reviews as of 2014: 1.05 million on CNN and 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at prime time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. The "Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC, however, has ratings of up to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important headlines, surpassing Fox.
"People get caught in this fire because they don't understand it," said Neal Bear, producer of the drama Designated Survivor on ABC. The focus of the series is a minister who unexpectedly becomes president after a terrorist attack that destroys the Capitol.
The experienced comedy writer and writer of “Just the Funny Parts” and “Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club” Nell Scovell sees things differently.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston ahead of the election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She wanted to know: "Why?"
"He said," The reason is, he makes me laugh, "Ms. Scovell told me.
This mess is quite entertaining.
The difference between what is happening in Washington now and everything else that's on television right now is that it is the future of Roe v. Wade could decide. And not just the future of Wade, but also that of bringing migrant families together and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only particularly privileged viewers can afford.
The definition of an informed citizen certainly does not include watching a six-hour expert discussion giving opinions on Bob Woodward's “in-depth knowledge” that went into his book “Fear,” about Paul Manafort's ostrich leather jacket for $ 15,000 that the Washington Post referred to as "a garment full of arrogance," or about the aftermath of Donald Trump's witty description of, shall we say, swapping anatomy for Stormy Daniels.

When I caught Mr. Fleiss this week it was 28 degrees outside his house on the north bank of Kauai and the sun was shining, but he was watching MSNBC and taping CNN.
Pulling himself off seemed impossible to him - at least until it was clarified what was going to happen to Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee and, in the future, the Supreme Court.
Mr. Fleiss said to me: "I still remember how we put on all these crazy shows back then and how people told me that this was the beginning of the downfall of the West."
"I thought it was a joke, but it became clear that you were right."

External funds influence the closest races in the midterm elections to the lower house
The fact that Pennsylvania's 17th constituency is being flooded with money comes as no surprise due to a congressional reorientation that resulted in two incumbents running for the same seat.
Conor Lamb of the Democratic Party runs for the new district in the suburb of Pittsburg. Last spring he was given the seat for another district in a special election.
Lamb's competitor is Republican Keith Rothfus. This is currently the representative of the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which has clear overlaps with the new 17th district.
When the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituencies were being manipulated unconstitutionally for the benefit of Republicans, the political maps were redrawn.
In the new 17th district, the race has sparked a debate on campaign funding between the main parties funding groups, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
After a clear victory in the special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania in March, Lamb came to prominence in the state.
President Donald Trump won this district, which has been firmly in Republican hands for more than a decade, by a margin of 20 points.
According to political experts, the Democrats are slightly ahead.
USA - Harsh sanctions against El Salvador due to the support of China, then withdrawal
According to diplomats, there was little protest from Washington when the Dominican Republic and Panama sided with Beijing.
In June 2017 there was a friendly meeting between Donald Trump and Juan Carlos Varela, the President of Panama. Before the Trump company's management team was expelled by the partners, Trump had a hotel there.
Earlier this month, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert announced that US State Department officials had decided to withdraw US ambassadors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in light of the “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan” .
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador. The country received approximately $ 140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including anti-drug trafficking, development aid, and economic aid.
The Central American country, with its high number of unemployed and murder cases, would have suffered from the proposed sanctions, such as the reduction in financial aid and specific visa restrictions.
A similar conference last year was seen as a step in the right direction with regard to efforts to bar migrants from entering the United States, which is why a gathering of high-ranking officials, at which the issues of security and economic living standards were the focus, during the internal Talks by government officials from North America and Central America has been postponed.
A continuation of the conference and thus a de facto end of the examination of sanctions against El Salvador was in the interest of top officials. They made this clear to the government by mid-September.
Diplomats announced that it is now foreseen that Vice President Mike Pence will address the meeting, scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the importance of the conference to the government.
The three US diplomats returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without much fuss, without renewed harsh comments or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton did not comment on the details of the discussion that the three US representatives described, including two diplomats who, provided they could remain anonymous, wanted to comment on the internal talks.
An outside government analyst confirmed their reports on the condition that he was not identified by name.
Learn history
Trump threatens new hardship with the report by special investigator Robert Mueller. This mentions that the president might have obstructed the judiciary - there is already solid evidence of this in publicly available documents.
The question of whether Trump's campaign team was doing a secret thing with Russia when it launched an attack on our vote was also investigated by Mr. Mueller.
Should there be a change in the majority in Congress, Trump will have to answer to this institution when he is preparing for his next election campaign. He may even have to give an account one day in a court made up of party colleagues.
It depends on a lot of things. I do not mean to claim that there is no alternative to replacing Mr. Trump - or his counterparts in Europe.
Decisions are due on both sides of the Atlantic and will determine how long the struggle lasts.
In 1938, German officers were ready to put on a coup against Hitler if the Western countries had opposed his demands and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, have not taken the opportunity to prevent the years of violence that have ensued.
Such turning points play a decisive role in the course of history and can slow or stimulate the unavoidable advance of democracy.
Today, Americans are facing several such turning points.
What should we do if Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's deputy - the man responsible for Mueller's investigation?
The document says that Rosenstein proposed last year that the president be accepted without his knowledge and questioned his suitability for the position, which is why he has had problems since this document was published.
The Times report is incorrect, claims Rosenstein.
"What do we do if the FBI's newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or not impartial - or if he is appointed Chief Justice even if allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony are serious?"
Most importantly, will we meanwhile cast our vote for a Congress that will hold Mr Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, things will not look good for democracy.
However, I learned something in Prague and am therefore convinced that we will not end up as losers.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia. The same Nazi regime that used to seize my ambassadorial residence deported them to Auschwitz.
She sent me Sabbath candles to burn on the swastika table - six decades after she survived and emigrated to the United States.
With this legacy, I have little choice but to look positively into the future. "

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna.
On Thursday the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna and know that if they win against the Austrians after the convincing tie against Villareal in Spain earlier this month, they have the best chances of qualifying from Group G for the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans believes the 2-2 draw against Villareal could give the Rangers a boost to achieve greater things, including missing the game with a knee injury and continuing to wait for his first appearance of the season.
According to the 31-year-old man, the point was good for them due to the skills of the Villarreal team.
“We went into this game with the confidence that we could make a difference. In the end we got a point.
Overall, the draw was probably a fair result, even if we could have taken it away from them towards the end.
The others were probably better in the first half, but in the second we showed our full commitment and had an advantage.
Next Thursday will be another important evening for Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a great result in the last game. However, I am sure that we will get through and get a good result because we have the crowd behind us.
The last year was definitely exhausting - with everything that happened with my injuries and the upheavals in the club itself. But now you feel good in this place.
The team is great, the players are having fun and training is going great.
I hope that we can now exert pressure, forget the past season and achieve success. "
This fear for their retirement savings causes women to sleep without sleep.
Not many of the respondents spoke to their relatives about the form in which they would like to receive care, although many of them had a clear picture of it.
About 50% of respondents in the nationwide survey said they would talk to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
The figures show that only 10 percent discuss this issue with their children.
"People want someone in their family to take care of them, but they shy away from talking to them," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life at Nationwide.
This is how you begin.
Discussions with your partner and your children are inevitable and the only way to communicate your wishes to them in order to prepare them for the eventuality that care is required.
Because decisions made can have a strong impact on the calculated costs, you should discuss with a counselor and your family where and in what form the care should be taken.
Contact your financial advisor: with the help of your advisor, you can also find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed with a classic long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance with capital commitment to cover these costs or self-insurance with private assets - provided you have the appropriate money.
Complete your identification documents: prepare for legal disputes over your passport.
In order to control your medical care and to ensure that doctors and nurses act according to your wishes, if you can no longer make yourself understood, take care of a health care proxy and appoint a person of trust.
A power of attorney over your assets would also be an option for you.
You can choose someone you trust who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are still paid if you are not able to do so yourself.
It all comes down to the little details: What if your older parent got into a medical emergency and was on their way to the hospital.
Would you provide answers to some questions about health care and allergies?
Put this information in writing in order to be prepared.
Martin asked: "So it is not only the financial situation that is decisive, but also who the doctors are?"
Which of them are the drugs?
Who takes care of the dog?

According to the police, the shooting at around 2:30 am BST was a "random act".
The attacker was not seen by his victim.
The injuries he sustained are not life threatening and observers were urged to contact the police.
Indonesia: earthquakes and tsunamis
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed in a violent earthquake and subsequent tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise.
At this time, the civil protection authorities are unable to find out more about Donggala Governorate, an area closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake in northern Palu, as all communication lines are down.
Over 16,000 people had to be brought to safety in Palu after the tragedy.
Here is some important information about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu, capital of the Sulawesi Tengah province, is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and, according to estimates, had around 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami occurred as the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a government district that extends over more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the Sulawesi island.
According to estimates from 2017, the number of inhabitants in the administrative district (this is how the next smallest regional administrative unit after the province is called) was 299,200.
In the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the administrative district of Donggala on the coast, the population is primarily dependent on fishing and animal and plant breeding.
The province also lives from nickel mining, but mostly in Morowali, on the coast on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century.
In 1938, a tsunami killed 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also devastated western Donggala. Nine people were killed then.
Indonesia is located above the Pacific Ring of Fire with high seismic activity and the country is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These earthquakes and tsunamis were among the largest in recent years:
2004: 226,000 people, more than 50% of them in Aceh, fell victim to a tsunami on the coast of the Indian Ocean that was triggered by a tremor on the western coast of the Indian administrative district of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th and had an impact in Had 14 states.
2005: In late March and early April, several violent earthquakes take place on the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, an earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale occurs. The tremors triggered a tsunami that struck the south coast of the island and killed up to 700 people.
A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred in 2009 near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra's administrative district.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
Several dozen small towns and around 300 people fell victim to a tsunami ten meters high in 2010, which was caused by a magnitude 7.5 quake on one of the Mentai Islands off Sumatra.

Domestic violence - Sarah Palin eldest son in custody
Track Palin, eldest offspring of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and a candidate for the vice-presidency, was taken into custody for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilia, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence. According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, reports of domestic violence and resistance to state violence have already been received.
The police report shows that he snatched the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to contact the police and tell them about the alleged crime.
According to reports from KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held with an unsecured note of $ 500.
In court on Saturday, when asked "guilty or not guilty", he declared himself "not guilty," according to the network.
The lawsuit against Palin includes three Class A offenses. He may face a prison sentence of up to one year and fines of up to $ 250,000.
A class B violation, for which he must also answer in court, can be punished with a one-day jail sentence and a $ 2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
He allegedly attacked his father Todd Palin, according to an allegation from December 2017.
The police were notified by his mother, Sarah Palin, who was reporting on the alleged attack.
The negotiations for this process are currently taking place in the Alaska Veterans Court.
He was charged with domestic violence in January 2016 for meddling in a report of domestic violence and gun possession, and he was severely drunk in the incident.
According to his girlfriend's allegations, he hit her in the face.
Veterans' organizations criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for basing her son's violent rioting on post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his military service in Iraq.
Hundreds die in the Indonesian earthquake tsunami
The earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday claimed 384 lives.
The earthquake, which reached a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, resulted in a tsunami and brought down thousands of houses.
Power and communication networks have failed and the death toll is expected to continue to rise in the coming days.
Central Sulawesi in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, was affected by the earthquake.
Videos documenting the time the quake started can be found on social networks.
When the tsunami hit the country, several hundred people were holding a city festival in Palu City.
Federal prosecutor calls for the death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York - a rare sentence
New York Prosecutor's Office calls for Sayfullo Saipov to be sentenced to death. He is suspected of being behind the terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people were killed. This would be an unusually harsh sentence as there has been no execution in New York State since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot for the attack on a bicycle lane parallel to the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he ran over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the declaration of intent issued in the southern district of New York to demand an execution, the public prosecutor had to prove that Saipov had "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious physical damage in order to legitimize an execution can.
According to the court's records, the death penalty can be imposed on both counts.
In addition to criminal proceedings for violence and the demolition of motorized vehicles, a federal jury opened criminal proceedings against Saipov several weeks after the attack with 22 counts, including eight charges of murder in unity with the extortion of protection money, which the federal prosecutors normally for the use organized crime.
According to prosecutors, such an attack requires “basic planning and preparation”. They describe the implementation of Saipov as "disgusting, cruel and dirty".
The letter of intent states: “Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov is responsible for the calamity, damage and loss suffered by the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco had to suffer disaster. "
Five Argentine tourists were among the victims.
It has been more than ten years since a case involving the death penalty was heard in the southern borough of New York.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found to have murdered two drug deliverers, but in September 2019 he was ultimately given a life sentence.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in 1953, on the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had previously been convicted of spying for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, both Rosenbergs were executed using the electric chair.
According to the court's records, the Uzbek Saipov was not repentant enough in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he claimed to the investigators that he looked back on his actions with a good feeling.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had the idea of the attack while watching ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
According to the police, he requested that the ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders entrusted with the defense of Saipov, said he was "obviously frustrated" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that choosing the death penalty, rather than imposing life imprisonment with no early release in return for a confession of guilt, will only delay the trauma that these events left on everyone involved," said the author Patton.
Saipov's defense lawyers had previously asked prosecutors not to impose the death penalty.
According to a member of the Conservative Party, NIGEL FARAGE is to be blamed for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people's army” today at a demonstration during the meeting of the Conservative Party.
The former UKIP chairman said politicians should feel the anger of eurosceptics. A MP from Theresa Mays' camp then said that he had to take responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
During the protest march in Birmingham, the conservative backbencher Peter Bone said that the UK would be "out" if Farage had taken over the office of Brexit Minister.
In addition, conservative retainers who took part in a separately held anti-Brexit demonstration in the city added to the challenge May is currently facing in trying to bring about unity in the divided parliament.
Maintaining the path chosen with her Checkers compromise plan under the attacks of Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU is no easy undertaking for the Prime Minister.
Her allies insisted that despite the backlash, she would continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, forcing EU and Labor skeptics to either vote for their package or opt for the "mess".
At the "Leave Means Leave" event in Solihull, Mr. Bone said he wanted "Chuck Checkers".
His proposal was to put Farage on the same level and make the EU negotiations his responsibility.
He remarked: "We would have got outside long ago if he could have decided".
"I will work for Brexit, but the Checkers plan must be discarded," said the MP for Wellingborough.
One did not take part in world wars in order to present oneself submissively, he said and explained why he rebelled against the EU.
In our own country we want to write our own laws. "
Bone denied the idea that the population could have changed their minds since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British could have changed their minds and want to stay is completely absurd."
Participants in the protest also included Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns from the British Conservative Party. She told the press: “All I can say is: Prime Minister, you have to listen to the people.
The Checkers plan does not meet with much public approval, the opposition will not support it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who demonstrate outside and who made our election victory possible.
Forget the Checkers suggestion and listen to the following.
If they keep their promises, the prime ministers will stay in office, she added in a message leaked to Ms. May.
During the election campaign event, Farage said that politicians should be made to "feel the heat" they would have to expect if they betrayed the outcome of the referendum.
He explained that it was now a matter of trust among each other - between the population and the guild of politicians.
You want to denounce Brexit. We have gathered here today to shout to them, "You will not get away with it."
"Show the politicians who are about to betray our exit from the EU that it won't work that way - that's my wish," he added in an announcement to the raging audience.
We continue to work to mobilize the people's army in this country, which helped us win the Brexit vote and which cannot be appeased. Only in this way will we achieve our goal of an independent, autonomous, proud Britain.
Before the start of the two-hour event in the city center, the Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham.
After the association was founded, a group of activists displayed their “Tories Against Brexit” banners at the weekend.
At the beginning of the conference, the Tories received ridicule from Lord Adonis, a member of the Labor Party, for the security holes in their party app
He added that these are the very people who say they have control over the IT systems and all technologies for Canada and who, as a result of smooth controls at the borders, are able to conduct unrestricted free trade in Ireland.
It is an absolutely unworthy spectacle.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for the presidential election.
The American Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would deal with a presidential candidacy for the first time after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe wrote that the Massachusetts Democrat was speaking about her prospects at a town hall meeting on Saturday in the west of the state.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, faces re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was one of the leaders of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been traded as a possible rival candidate for Trump in the 2020 election for some time.
The event at Holyoke City Hall on Saturday evening was the 36th gathering with voters since Trump took office as US President.
She was asked by one participant if she would like to stand for the presidency.
Warren countered that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government. A woman in a leadership position is a natural part of this.
After the shooting of Sims, a basketball player from LSU, he was arrested
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police announced the arrest on Friday of a person on suspicion related to the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police said that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11:00 am. ET press conference.
On Friday they made a video of the filming public and asked for help in identifying a man who was on the film.
On Friday morning Sims, 20 years old, was killed with a gun near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247 Sport.
Simpson killed Wayde with a gun when he came in to protect his friend.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed that he was at the scene, had a gun, and shot Wayde Sims and killed.
Simpson did not oppose the arrest and is now in a holding cell at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
An eleventh grader who grew up in Baton Rouge, who was 2 m tall, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes of playing time, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton catches up with the World Championship after defeating Sebastian Vettel through team orders
When Valtteri Bottas placed ahead of Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it was certain that the team order at Mercedes would be of great importance in the race.
Hamilton was almost left alone by Bottas, who started the race from position 1 and got off to a good start because he was defending his place in the first two laps and asked Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pits first and let Hamilton continue. Then he followed the team onto the track, which was ultimately decisive.
Hamilton drove another lap in the Mercedes and came out of Vettel, but drove away after a wheel-to-wheel duel, because the Ferrari driver had to leave the inside open so as not to risk a double pull, and he was in the third corner to return the favor.
Max Verstappen, who entered the race from the back row of the starting field, managed to achieve seventh place on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap.
For long stretches of the race he was in the lead or clung to the tires of fourth-placed Kimi Raikkonen in order to be able to overtake him and get over the home straight as quickly as possible.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps. Raikkonen came in fourth.
The day was difficult because Valtteri did an excellent job on Saturday and Sunday and passed me by as a true gentleman.
The team did an amazing job to get first and second, ”said Hamilton.
The body language was really bad.
During an appearance on Saturday, President Donald Trump poked fun at Senator Dianne Feinstein for withholding the letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not immediately respond to Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he noted that what went on in the Senate was an example of people being "mean, evil and dishonest."
He remarked: "The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate these days, when you see the anger, the people who are upset and vicious and vicious and perfidious and lying".
“There are public documents and leaks, but they still say,“ Oh, I'm not responsible for that.
That was not me."
You know what?
Did the leaks come from you, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember how you answered? Did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, oh, oh, what?
Nail polish!
"I haven't passed it on to the public."
So give me a minute
Did we leak? We didn't leak ”, he added, imitating the senator.
As early as September it became known that Feinstein received the document with the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July - Feinstein denied that it had leaked from her office to the public.
According to The Hill, Feinstein said to the committee: "I have not [...] kept Ford's claims a secret and I have not leaked their story."
"I was asked by her to treat it confidentially, and according to her wishes I have complied with it."
However, the president was not impressed by their rejection. In his address on Saturday evening he said: Let me tell you that, the body language was really bad.
Maybe it wasn't, but I've never seen such bad body language. "
The candidate for the Supreme Court was accused of sexual assault by three women. The president is defending him, suggesting that the Democrats would exploit these allegations to their advantage.
“You are determined to use whatever means necessary to regain power.
All they see is wickedness and meanness and they don't care who they hurt and who to eliminate in order to gain more power and control, "the president said in his speech, according to Mediaite.

The air traffic controller ensures that hundreds of aircraft avoid the earthquake - and are killed in the process.
After an Indonesian air traffic controller died, he is now revered as a hero because he managed to safely land an airplane with hundreds of people on board.
After the severe earthquake and the subsequent tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, more than 800 people died; many more people are still missing.
In the city of Palu, many people are trapped in the remains of the buildings and the area continues to be hit by strong aftershocks.
Even though his colleagues were running for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung persisted in his post in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was shaken by the violent tremors.
Because he wanted to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was standing on the tarmac at the time, could take off without any problems, he didn't move.
Convinced that the traffic control tower would collapse, he finally jumped off it.
He later died in the clinic from his injuries.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Strait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We have made preparations for him to be transferred by helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger clinic in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we heard about it, we were devastated," he added.
According to official information from the authorities, the number of deaths could have reached several thousand by now. The civil protection agency announced that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was difficult.
“We assume that there will be even more deaths. There are still many bodies under the rubble and we cannot penetrate too many of the victims, ”said the spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
Palu, where a mass funeral is being held this Sunday, was devastated by waves up to six meters high.
The aid and supplies are brought to the disaster area by both military and civil aircraft.
A body is brought in by an ambulance every 60 seconds, a 35-year-old mother named Risa Kasuma told Sky News.
There is a lack of clean water.
Thefts occur in all small shops.
The head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working day and night to help the survivors. However, we have no idea what they will find there.
The whole thing may get worse, even if it's already a drama. "
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo traveled to Palu on Sunday and called on the military: "Please work all day and night so that the evacuation and all related tasks can be successfully completed."
Are you ready? ”Reported CNN.
The Indonesian island of Lombok was hit by earthquakes this year, in which more than 550 people lost their lives.
Airplane accident in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini, a man is now considered missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
After previously claiming that all 47 passengers and crew members survived the flight that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, the airline responsible now admits that one man is still missing.
According to a statement from Air Niugini, responsibility for a male passenger could not be assumed as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passengers, such as age and nationality.
Local boats were involved in rescuing the travelers and the crew of the plane that fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Seven people were admitted to a clinic, the civil servants said on Friday.
According to the airline, six passengers were in inpatient treatment on Saturday. The condition was stable for everyone.
Both the cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
According to the airline and the US Navy, the aircraft landed in the lagoon, just before the runway.
According to witness statements, the plane went off the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane flew very low.
“That's a good thing indeed,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and a few others managed to get through the waist-high water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to his reports, the flight attendants panicked and screamed. He was slightly injured in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, seafarers involved in jetty repairs helped with the rescue efforts by using a rubber dinghy to get passengers to safety before the machine sank in about 30 meters of water.
Aviation Safety Network information indicates that there have been 111 casualties in airline crashes registered with PNG in the past twenty years, but Air Niugini was not among them.
The chronological sequence of the night in which a woman was burned alive was simulated by an analyst.
Prosecutors ended the argument on Saturday in the retrial of a man alleged to have burned alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett, who was appointed as a reviewer, put several hours of effort into evaluating the information.
He outlined for the jury, using recordings on his mobile phone, the deeds of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis on the night he was alleged to have murdered 19-year-old Jessica Chambers.
According to a report by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett received location data from multiple cell phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his earlier statements.
The analysis of the data on Chambers cell phone revealed that he had spent time with his friend Michael Sanford. Sanford was then questioned by investigators.
Sanford gave his testimony on Saturday, stating that he was out of town that day.
After prosecutors asked Tellis if he had spent the night in Sanford's truck, the latter said his testimony was a lie because his truck was located in Nashville at the time.
Tellis' statement that he had known Chambers for around two weeks at the time of her death was also a contradiction.
According to the records on the cell phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis removed text messages, call and contact information from his phone after Chamber died.
Hale stated: "To him she no longer exists."
The defense will hold its closing argument on Sunday.
The judge stated that he believed the trial would later be transferred to the jury.
The High Breed: What is Reflective Hip-Hop?
Three hip-hoppers want to improve the genre's bad image by bringing positive statements to their music.

They strive to get back to the roots of this style of music and popularize hip-hop that is self-aware.
In the UK, artists like The Fugees and Common are making a comeback, sparked by the music of Akala, Lowkey and others.
Black again ?!
Nanny from New York sues couple for dismissal with “racist” text message.
A New York couple is sued by their former nanny. The parents are said to have terminated the woman for discriminatory reasons. This is proven by a letter from the mother, which got into the hands of the nanny and contains a complaint about “still a black woman”.
The couple denied being racist and described the lawsuit as "blackmail".
The fact that the new nanny Giselle Maurice turned out to be black on her first day at work in 2016 caused outrage among the mother of two Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman.
A text message from Ms. Plasco-Flaxmann to her husband read: "Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo."
She sent it to Frau Maurice twice instead of sending it to her husband.
After realizing her mistake, an "embarrassed" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying the outgoing African-American nanny had not done well and that she wanted to hire a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice received remuneration for her work that day and was then sent home by Uber.
Maurice is suing the couple and demanding compensation for the termination. He's charging $ 350 a day for the six-month full-time job originally agreed - albeit without a contract.
She told the Post on Friday that she wanted to show them that you don't do such things and that she knows that it is unequal treatment.
The couple contradict the allegations and say that the decision to quit Maurice was a sensible one and that it was taken because they were both concerned that they could no longer trust her after the insults they had voiced.
“She didn't want to reveal what, but my wife had sent her something.
She is not a racist person.
"We have no racist views," her husband Joel Plasco told the post.
"Would you leave your children in the care of someone you offended - even if it wasn't intended?"
Your baby who just came into the world?
Rather not."
According to Plasco, his wife was seven months pregnant and was therefore not up to date. For him, the lawsuit is “blackmail”.
"Would you like to attack such a person?"
The investment banker noted that it wasn't exactly a pretty thing.
Despite the ongoing legal process, the couple were quickly tried by the public on social networks and attacked for their behavior and views.
Paddington: A new letter shows that publishers feared that a talking bear would not be a figure of identification for readers.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: It is difficult to imagine reading it for the first time before publication.
"Now that we know Paddington's major achievement, it's really funny."
She said: “My father used to work as a cameraman for the BBC and then came up with the idea of writing a children's book about a little toy bear. Even if his work had been rejected, he would not have lost courage. ”She added:“ He died last year and the 60th anniversary of the book's publication is “painful and enjoyable” at the same time.
She said of Paddington, whom she calls a "very important family member," that her father was secretly proud of his overall success.
She explained: "He was a very quiet man, and by no means malicious."
It seemed as if it were your own offspring who are successful because Paddington seemed so real to him: Even if you don't actually contribute, you feel pride for the child.
He judged Paddington's positive result a bit like that, I think.
Even if it was his creation and his imagination, he himself repeatedly praised Paddington. "
When my daughter died, saying goodbye was only possible by phone.
After landing, her daughter was transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"Nad called me again and again and said that it really didn't look good and that she probably wouldn't make it," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me and said that she only had two minutes to live. I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did that.
"Tashi, I love you so much, darling," I explained.
I will be with you shortly.
I will be there for you."
The drugs that had been prescribed for her to keep her heart functioning slowly began to wear off and the medicine was broken down.
Her death some time earlier came to a halt.
I had no choice but to sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
In that position I could neither cry nor get loud because there were families and other people around me.
I had to try hard to keep my composure.
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, still in mourning for her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea of their torment.
She said nothing was known to anyone.
“I had turned my gaze to the floor and couldn't stop crying.
I can hardly put it into words, but on the flight I felt an indescribable sympathy for Nad.
My love and forbearance were essential to him.
I knew how much love he felt for her. "
Postcards to avoid suicide on a bridge are designed by affected women
After losing a loved one by killing themselves, the two women want to do something to dissuade others from suicide.
Notes with moving messages and phone numbers of Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were posted on a Welsh bridge for people to call for help.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler, was diagnosed with depression at the age of 13. At 18 he committed suicide.
"My wish is that no parent feels the same as I do every day," she said.
According to his mother, 45-year-old Ms. Davis from Lydney, he was a talented cook and had a smile that quickly spread to others.
“He was famous for his smile.
He is said to have brightened every room with his smile, that was often said about him. "
But he had stopped working before his death because his "mental state was very bad".
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler found his brother after he committed suicide.
"I worry all the time that this could have a domino effect," said Ms. Davis.
By designing the cards, Ms. Davis wanted to "convey to people that someone is there for them who will listen to them, even if it's just a friend."
You can't just sit there quietly, you have to speak. "
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, suffered the loss of her partner Mark, who was by her side for 15 years. Not long before that he had lost his mother.
She noted, "He didn't say to me that he wasn't feeling well or depressed or anything".
“A few days before Christmas we noticed that something had changed for him.
When the children opened their presents at Christmas, he didn't look them in the eye and didn't do anything - he was deeply sad. "
You have to mourn now, his passing was a strong emotional shock for them and left a notch in the family, she said.
We are torn apart by it.
But we have no choice but to stick with it and fight. "

With the FBI investigation under way, Brett Kavanaugh's future is now in jeopardy.
Mr Flake said on Saturday: "I hoped that by implementing his request - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could possibly achieve some consensus," and added that he was concerned that the committee would, in the face of a solid political blockade, " breaks apart ".
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Your reluctance has to do with timing.
In their efforts to get the votes for their candidate for the Supreme Court, the Republicans are likely to be weakened if they get the expected weak result in the mid-term elections on November 6 - there are only five weeks until then.
In phone calls with Senators, George W. Bush wanted to convince them to get involved with Mr. Kavanaugh, who met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's right hand man while working for Mr. Bush in the White House.
What will happen after the FBI report is released?
The Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is not yet certain whether Brett Kavanaugh can win 50 votes for his side in the Senate. In the event of a tie, Vice President Mike Pence would have the option to confirm Kavanaugh's admission to the Supreme Court at his own discretion.
Less people fled North Korea during Kim's reign
According to a South Korean MP, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Last year there were 1,127 cases of infidelity - in 2011 it was 2,706 - said Park Byeong-seug, referring to information from the South Unification Ministry.
An important factor in this are stricter controls at the border crossings between North Korea and China and a rise in the price of people smugglers, said Park.
There was no public comment from Pyongyang.
A large number of North Korean refugees ultimately get South Korean citizenship.
Since the Korean War ended in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border, according to Seoul.
Most of the refugees leave the country across the border with China, which has the longest common border with North Korea. Crossing this border is easier than crossing the strictly monitored Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China sees the deserters not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants and often has them deported under duress.
The situation between the north and south, between which the war was never officially ended, has greatly improved in recent months.
The leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang earlier this month to discuss the stalled negotiations over the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
This happened after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they largely agreed to make the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Secretary of State Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for little progress since then.
“If we can't trust the US, our country's security is at risk. Accordingly, unless the situation changes, unilateral weapons dismantling on our part is unthinkable at this point in time, ”said Ri in his lecture to the UN General Assembly in New York.
For a position at the Supreme Court, Nancy Pelosi finds Brett Kavanaugh useless according to his own statements, and he is also uncontrolled.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the Democratic opposition, described Brett Kavanaugh, who is running for the Supreme Court, as "hysterical" and unsuitable as a constitutional judge because of his personality.
Pelosi made these statements on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought to myself that a woman who acted this way would have been labeled 'hysterical," "said Pelosi of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Against the allegations that he sexually approached Dr. Christine Blasey Ford passed, Kavanaugh defended himself emotionally.
Kavanaugh displayed a lot of emotion during his opening speech, almost screaming and crying at times, while talking about his family and years in high school.
He described the allegations against him as an "absurd and organized smear campaign", staged by liberals frustrated by Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election, and explicitly reprimanded the Democrats on the panel.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that his prejudice against the Democrats made him unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
She said, "In my opinion, he is disqualifying himself with such claims and the way he is manipulated by the Clintons and the Democratic Party."
However, Pelosi hesitated when asked whether, if Kavanaugh was confirmed, she would initiate impeachment proceedings against him with a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.
Pelosi made the following statement: “I'm just saying, he is no more fit for a job on the Supreme Court than he is for a job in the court that currently employs him as a judge if he's dishonest to Congress and the FBI . "
Kavanaugh is currently a District Judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
In addition, Pelosi said, as a Democrat, she worries that Kavanaugh may violate the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade could vote because he is known as a staunch conservative.
During the questioning of Kavanaugh for the purpose of his confirmation, this evaded questions aimed at preventing certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
“It cannot be possible today that a hysterical, partisan person wants to go to court and expects that people respond enthusiastically,” said Pelosi.
And women have no choice but to put up with it.
Without shedding tears, she cannot take it out, this lecture, which almost calls for incitement, these months and years filled with anger.
Forty-five years later, Ms. Steinem told me: "If we get angry, we promised to shed tears."
"I think it happens, doesn't it?"
She continued: “The words of a woman from the management helped me. She told me that she often cried with anger, but she had internalized the following approach: Whenever she got angry and tears welled up in her eyes, she said to the person she was speaking to: “You may think that I'm crying because I'm sad am
I'm pissed off."
And then she just continued doing what she did.
That was brilliant, was my thought. "
Tears are accepted as expressions of anger because they are fundamentally misinterpreted
Strongest memories of a former job in a male-dominated office include an elderly woman grabbing my neck and an elderly man I was always afraid of dragged me down a stairwell. I was so angry at the time that I cried.
She said to me, "Never let them see you cry."
“You are not aware of your anger.
They believe that you are sad and will be happy to have met you. "
The then Democratic Congressman Patricia Schroeder had campaigned for Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987 the extramarital affair of Mr. Hart on a boat called "Monkey Business" became public and he withdrew his candidacy. Ms. Schroeder was extremely disappointed and saw no reason not to run for president herself.
Thirty years later, she said to me, “The decision was not considered carefully,” and laughed.
“We already had seven competitors in this race. We really didn't need another one.
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" is the title that someone has come up with.
Campaigning long ago, she lagged behind in raising funds and declared that she would not campaign unless she managed to raise $ 2 million.
That was an argument that couldn't be won.
She noted that even though those men paid $ 1,000, she received only $ 250 from some of her followers.
She asked herself, "Do they think the praise for me is premature?"
Emotions overwhelmed her during her speech and announcement that she would not start an official campaign - gratitude to the people who offered her support, frustration at the system that made it so complicated to collect donations and reach voters rather than delegates, and Anger at sexism - that her voice failed.
She has not forgotten the reaction of the press to her: "It looked like I was suffering from an acute stress reaction."
“He looked like I was sponsored by Kleenex.
It occurs to me that I was wondering what words they would choose for my tombstone.
"Did the tears come to you?"
How Beijing could benefit from the trade war between China and the United States
The first round of the US-Chinese trade war caused a sensation worldwide, and there are no signs of an end to the conflict anytime soon. According to experts, the rift that has opened up between the two countries could bring long-term benefits to China.
The first warning from US President Donald Trump came at the beginning of the year in the form of taxation on important exports from China, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation got completely out of hand after the US set new tariffs on imports of goods from China this week at $ 200 billion (£ 150 billion).
Again and again the receipts came from Beijing in the form of benefits in kind, and most recently it was decided to levy five to ten percent tariffs on US goods amounting to 60 billion dollars.
China responds to every blow from the US with a counter-blow and it cannot be assumed that the world's second largest economy will bow to the pressure in the foreseeable future.
It would be too embarrassing for China's head of state Xi Jinping to publicly accept the will of the US, even if accepting the demands would be the way to induce the US to compromise.
Should Beijing make good use of its opportunities, however, the trade war with the US could be good for China in the long term, as the mutual dependence of the two economies on one another could be reduced, according to experts.
"What observers have underestimated so far is the risk that spontaneous political decisions by the US or Chinese governments can shake the economy in the other country," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank focused on Asia, is working.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is “prepared” for the return of refugees.
Seeking assistance in its recovery from the devastating devastation of over seven years of war, Syria says that all preparations have been made for those who have left the country to return of their own free will.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told the UN General Assembly that conditions in the country were improving.
He said: "Thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is now stabilized and improved."
The government hopes that further rehabilitation of the areas destroyed by terrorism will bring about a return to normalcy.
After being forced to leave their homes by terror and unilateral economic measures that made everyday life and an income impossible, the situation now allows refugees to return voluntarily.
According to estimates by the UN, over 5.5 million Syrians have left their country as refugees since the war began in 2011.
The more than six million people who continue to live in the country are in dire need of humanitarian assistance.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian government would gratefully accept help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He emphasized that he would not accept limited funds and aid from countries that participated financially in the riot.
Europe is victorious at the Ryder Cup in Paris
With a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 points against Team USA, Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018, which was held at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The USA has already recorded six defeats in a row in Europe. They haven't won the Ryder Cup here since 1993 either.
The European team took the lead again as captain Thomas Björns' Danes scored the 14.5 points it took to beat the USA.
US star Phil Mickelson was in trouble for most of the tournament and when he tee-off at the 16th hole in the par-3, his ball landed in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The golfer Molinari from Italy put in a brilliant performance in all his rounds and became one of four players who played 5-0-0 since the first tournament in 1979.
The Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, the player with the worst score in the European team, managed a 5 & 4 victory against the American Jordan Spieth.
The first class Dustin Johnson was defeated by the Englishman Ian Poulter with 2 and 1 points. For the latter, it may be his last participation in the Ryder Cup.
With 25.5 career points, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in the Ryder Cup eight times, is the most successful European to date at this tournament.
“I'm actually not prone to tears. But there is no other way today.
This was a tough year.
I feel very grateful to Thomas for the fact that he accommodated me and was convinced of me.
Getting the trophy back makes me so happy, so happy.
This is about the team, and I'm glad I was able to help, ”said Garcia after the European team won.
After John Ram had defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods with 2 and 1 in a single game on Sunday, he received the baton from his compatriot.
The 23-year-old Rehm says he is incredibly proud to have defeated the idol of his childhood with Tiger Woods.
After losing all four games in France, Woods ‘Ryder Cup results are 13-12-3.
For one of the top players since time immemorial, who like Jack Nicklaus is the only one to have won 14 important titles, the statistics are extraordinary.
Team USA made every effort to purchase flights for all team members with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had already participated in the golf tournament.
"I'm proud of our team, they gave everything," said US captain Jim Furyk after his team's sobering appearance.
This morning we had an opportunity to put pressure on Europe.
We screwed up.
Respect for thomas.
He is an outstanding captain.
The performance of all of his twelve players was outstanding.
The team will be reassembled, I myself will work closely with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will ensure that we develop further.
I love her very much and I am proud to be her trainer.
That deserves respect.
You have surpassed us. "
