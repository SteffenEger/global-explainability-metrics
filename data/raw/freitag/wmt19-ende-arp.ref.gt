Wales MPs feared portraying "fools".
Several AMs expressed concern at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This came about because of ideas to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament in future.
Assembly members from all parties fear that this will all turn into a ludicrous business.
According to a Labor MP, his group is concerned because "Twp rhymes with Pwp".
To explain for readers who don't speak Welsh, in Welsh twp means weak-headed, while pwp means shit.
According to a plaid delegate, the group as a whole is “not happy” and has suggested other names.
A Welsh Conservative said his group would be "open" to changing the name, but noted that the verbal jump from "MWP" to "Muppet" was very short.
The pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to that of the letter u in the English Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a draft law to introduce name changes, remarked: "Of course, how the assembly members should definitely be designated, the final decision on the members personally."
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh National Assembly received permission to rename itself.
The results of a public consultation on the proposed names published by the Commission in June show that the name Welsh Parliament met with strong approval.
The Commission gave preference to the name “Welsh Parliament Member” or “WMP” as the title of Assembly Members, but “MWP” was the preferred choice for a public consultation.
AMS may have other proposals, but it could be difficult for President Elin Jones, who is expected to draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks, to reach an agreement.
The reform legislation includes additional changes to the committee's working method, including rules on AM exclusion and the organization of the exclusion system.
In the end, in the debate on the law, the congregation members vote on what their future name should be.
The population of Macedonia goes to the polls to change the country name in a referendum
On Sunday, voters will have the opportunity to use their vote to decide whether the new name of the country should be “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The goal of the referendum is to resolve a decades-long dispute with the Greek neighbor, who has its own province called Macedonia.
For a long time Athens insisted on the claim that the name of its neighbor to the north constituted a claim on Greek territory and repeatedly rejected its applications for EU and NATO membership.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia and against the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, justified the name change by stating that the name change was necessary for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are no longer ringing because a battle of the churches is ongoing in Harlem
Mr. Adams said that according to the old people he spoke to, there were bars and churches all over the place.
"Today there are neither options."
In his opinion, it was understandable that more and more bars were closing.
He explained: "People today maintain their contacts by other means."
"Bars are no longer like neighbors' living rooms where people meet repeatedly."
With regard to churches, he fears that the proceeds from the sale of assets will not take as long as leaders expect it to be, and "it is only a matter of time before you have to start over."
He continued: "Housing complexes with the kind of people who will not help the remaining refuges in the vicinity could replace the churches."
“The people who buy condominiums in these condominiums will be mostly white,” he said, “and the day the churches will definitely close, because most of the future residents of these condominiums will probably not move into them later Enter churches. "
The two churches were built by white congregations - the Metropolitan Community in 1879 and St. Martin‘s in 1880 - before Harlem turned into a black metropolis.
In the 1930s, the first white Methodist church left this place.
A community of blacks who had celebrated holy masses nearby bought the property rights to the building.
Under the leadership of Reverent John Howard Johnson, the leader of a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets that refused to hire or promote blacks, St. Martin became a black community.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for rebuilding and commissioned the chimes.
Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, Rev. Davin Johnson, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor people".
The specialist who played the carillon in July chose different words. He spoke of “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also underlined that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician - Dionisio A. Lind, and that it was in the more important carillon in the world 18 years ago Riverside Church had moved.
Mr. Merriweather announced that St. Martin's had not put anyone in his place.
What has happened in the past few months at the Church of St. Martin is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were contracted by lay leaders and others by the diocese of bishops.
In July, the sacristy - the leading parish body made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese, expressing concerns that the diocese "may be able to pass the costs on to the sacristy" even though the sacristy is not involved in recruiting those from the diocese commissioned architects and contractors had been involved.
Several members of the parish expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old is injured by a shark while diving for lobsters in California
Authorities announced that a 13-year-old was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for lobsters on Saturday, the opening day of California's lobster season.
The attack occurred at 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning about half a group of friends had already been diving with friends when he heard the boy's cries for help. He then paddled with a group to the boy to save him.
At first Mutton thought the screams were enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but then “I noticed that he was screaming: He bit me!
He bit me!'
You could see his entire collarbone when I grabbed him, ”said Hammel.
"I called out to everyone:" There's a shark swimming there "so that everyone can come ashore immediately," added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is life threatening.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles announced at a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it turned out to be a non-dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had severe wounds on the upper body.
For 48 hours, law enforcement officers blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami‘s in Encinitas in order to investigate and secure the area.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of shark in this area, most of which are not classified as dangerous.
Sainsbury's intends to enter the cosmetics market in the UK.
Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams compete with Sainsbury‘s, where beauty items are sold in aisles like a department store and specialty salespeople are at work.
As part of a targeted extensive penetration of the UK beauty market, which is worth £ 2.8 billion and is growing continuously while sales of fashion and household goods are falling, the more spacious aisles of beauty products in 11 stores are being expanded tested and, if successful, will be set up in additional stores in the coming year.
One reason for increased investment in beauty products is that supermarkets want to make maximum use of the shelf space that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and home wear.
Sainsbury‘s said it wanted to double its cosmetics offering for the first time, up to 3,000 items, and brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Offering PawPaw.
The current product lines from L‘Oreal, Maybelline and Burt‘s Bees will also have more space. Similar to Boots, they are presented in separate areas according to brand.
In addition, the supermarket is renewing its range of boutique make-up and introducing a variety of vegan products - younger customers in particular are increasingly interested.
Perfumery chain The Fragrance Shop will also be testing Sainsbury's concessions in two stores. The first store opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second store is scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Due to online trading and the increasing number of daily necessities purchases made in local convenience stores, supermarkets are forced to do more to bring consumers to them.
Sainsbury‘s CEO Mike Coupe said the outlet stores were becoming more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggled to compete with the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more products and selling non-food products.
Sainsbury‘s has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and opened numerous Habitat stores after taking over both chains two years ago. According to the company, this has increased food sales and increased the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket's efforts to redesign its own beauty products and drugstore departments were unsuccessful.
Sainsbury‘s tried a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the merger was terminated after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the drugstores in the supermarkets.
Sainsbury‘s relies on this new strategy after selling its 281 department store pharmacies three years ago for £ 125 million to Celesio, already owner of the “Lloyds Pharmacy” chain.
Lloyds is expected to be involved in this plan, as four stores will offer a wider selection of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's Sales Manager Paul Mills-Hicks explains: “Our beauty aisles have been redesigned to give our customers an optimized environment.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will advise customers.
With our range of brands that meet all needs, the inviting ambience and the advantageous location, we are a sought-after supplier of beauty articles who question the previous ways of shopping. "
Peter Jones is 'upset' after Holly Willoughby leaves the £ 11m deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Johnes went 'furious' after TV host Holly Willoughby backed out of a £ 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new deals with Marks and to judge Spencer and ITV.
For his brand Truly - homewear and accessories - Willoughby could not find time.
There have been comparisons of the couple's company with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old talk show host of the breakfast program announced her intention to leave the station on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left an angry Dragons ‘Den star Peter Johnes alone after she unexpectedly stepped out of profitable lifestyle brands to pursue her own worthwhile new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
It was learned that Johnes was "maddened" when the TV Golden Girl announced at a meeting at her business realm headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she was running out of time on her new £ 1.5 million deals their homewear and acceccoire brand Truly.
The firm was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated £ 11 million net worth.
When Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones flew from the UK to one of his vacation homes.
It has been reported that Truly was absolutely the top priority for Holly.
It was her long-term future that she would build on for the next few decades.
After their decision to leave the company, everyone involved was hit by a blow.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. The beginning was just around the corner.
"There is a warehouse stocked with goods at Marlow headquarters as they are ready to go on sale."
In professional circles, it is firmly assumed that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most popular British stars, could cost the company millions because quite a lot has already been invested in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings of any further delays in starting the transmission.
Plus, it may mean the end of a longstanding friendship.
Mother of three, Willoughby, and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined in March.
The four of them went on vacation, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will act as the brand ambassador for Marks and Spencer, replacing McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV program I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not make a statement on his business affairs."
Sharp words "and then the love between us is kindled"
He joked about the expected critical remarks from the media for speaking in what for some "was inappropriate for a president" and for speaking positively about the head of state of North Korea.
Why did President Trump forego so much?
said Trump with his mocking “news anchor” voice.
"I have not given up anything."
He said: "Kim wants a second meeting after Trump touted their first meeting in Singapore in June as an important step in the denuclearization of North Korea."
But talks about denuclearization have stalled.
North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders three months after the Singapore summit in June on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North could not see an "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures .
He added that the US is instead maintaining the sanctions in order to continue to create pressure.
In his campaign speech, Trump was much more confident.
He said, "Things are going well with North Korea."
“We would have waged a war against North Korea.
There would have been millions of victims.
"Today our relationship is fantastic."
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: no more missile tests, assistance with the rescue of hostages and the transfer of deceased US soldiers.
He also justified his unconventional approach to discussing the mutual relationship with Kim.
Trump said, referring to the people standing in front of him, "Being the presidential is so easy, but we have about 200 people standing right there instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this overcrowded area."
Island in Indonesia destroyed by tsunami and earthquake, hundreds of deaths
The private aid organizations from abroad were told after the quake that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of Lombok's residents have been evacuated, no national catastrophe has been proclaimed, which would have been necessary in order to seek international assistance.
Ms. Sumbung explained that unfortunately in many places it was clearly stated that international aid would not be requested, which consequently made things comparatively difficult.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team for a trip to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign emergency services will be allowed to work on site.
According to Mr. Sutopo, representative of the national civil protection agency, Indonesian officials are examining the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations will be allowed to participate in the relief efforts.
Given that earthquakes are common in Indonesia, the country is still dismayingly unprepared for the violence of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been set up in Aceh, but there are not enough such facilities in other coastal areas.
The fact that there was clearly no tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the death toll.
Traveling from one main Indonesian island to the next is a difficult task at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more cumbersome
A hospital ship previously docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will not reach the new disaster site for at least three days.
Repairing the damaged Indonesian infrastructure is the focus of President Joko Widoko's election campaign and he has invested a lot of money in roads and railways.
But the term of office of Mr. Joko, who wants to be re-elected next year, was marked by financial bottlenecks.
Mr. Joko is also confronted with continuous tension on the part of the religious groups in Indonesia, with members of the Muslim majority embracing a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge picks up and equalizes against Chelsea
It was thanks to Daniel Sturridge and his 89th-minute goal that Liverpool didn't lose to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
When his side were 1-0 down, Sturridge accepted a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal.
He maneuvered the ball onto his left side and then shot towards the long post.
During the attempt, the ball flew high over the field and ended up in the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the leather fell past the rushing Kepa Arrizabalaga into the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: "I just wanted to get in this position, get the ball and players like Shaq are always trying to move forward so I tried to buy as much time as possible."
"I saw Edge come and plugged in a contact without really thinking about it, so I just took the punch."
At halftime, Chelsea were 1-0 up, thanks to a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian soccer star Eden Hazard.
In that game, the Blues striker gave the pass back to Mateo Kovacic and then ran close to midfield in Liverpool's half of the pitch after a spin-off.
Kovacic managed a quick one-two in midfield.
Then he made a great through ball and brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard left the defenders behind and finally took a long left shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker into the corner.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m. Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at the San Paolo Stadium.
On Thursday at 3 p.m., Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London.
In Indonesia there are now 832 fatalities from the tsunami
On Sunday morning, the civil protection agency announced that the death toll in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had increased to 832.
At a press conference, official Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: “Many people are buried under the rubble of the buildings that collapsed on Friday in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that generated waves 30 feet high.
The city of Palu with over 380,000 inhabitants was buried under the rubble of fallen houses.
After the death of a woman from stab wounds, the police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder
The murder investigation began after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. on John Street in Grayson Mews with stab wounds and a 32-year-old suspected of murder was arrested.
The police called on people in the area who noticed something to report to the police.
The message from Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan read: “We are only just beginning an investigation, but I urge anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and sees something suspicious to contact us.
I ask everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have dash cam recordings, to contact us as they may have information that is very important for our investigation.
A police representative confirmed that the woman's body found on private property came from Birkenhead.
Friends of the woman appeared on site that afternoon to ask where she was discovered that morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police are informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was about to go to his apartment, but the police let him know that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he had no words.
The residents were informed that they would not be allowed access again until several hours later.
A police officer was heard informing a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman ran on stage in tears.
She keeps saying: "It's so terrible."
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the fence and a third vehicle outside.
Numerous police officers kept an eye on the apartment block within the perimeter.
People with clues should send a direct message to @MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, referring to Protocol 247 of September 30th.
The current dispute over monuments with a dubious past is the Cromwell statue in front of Parliament
If it were removed, it would amount to a compensatory justice for the destruction of such a large number of cultural and religious British cultural goods by its fanatical, strict followers, reminiscent of the Taliban policy.
The Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's idea "an absurdity" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
The Cromwell Society Chairman John Goldsmith commented, “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was bound to come into focus that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would come into focus.
Cromwell neither gave nor carried out the order for the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
The fake Cromwell might have been sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas over the past century.
With his wonderful portrayal of Cromwell, Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft supports the view widespread in the 19th century, and it is part of the history of a person who, in the opinion of many, should be celebrated.
Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr. Goldsmith said: "Many people, possibly in the late 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to be the advocate of Parliament against external pressure, in his case obviously against the monarchy."
The current historical discussions deal with the question of how realistic this description is.
There is no doubt that the dispute in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country and that Cromwell was a person who was held in high regard and stood for one side of this division.
One should also celebrate and acknowledge one's successes as protector of the Lords. "
Chinese farmer is killed by pig by bite
Local media reports indicate that a man was bitten to death by a pig in a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, who only named his family name "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery. He was in a pool of blood on the floor of a pigsty in Liupanshui Market, Guizhou Province.
A pig farmer on May 30, 2005 in Xining, in the Chinese province of Qinghai, preparing for the vaccination of his pigs.
He is said to have traveled to the market with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The morning after, his cousin discovered him dead and noticed that a door to an adjacent pigsty was open.
According to him, a large boar in the pigsty has traces of blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination is said to have proven that the farmer was bitten to death by the 550-pound pig.
The cousin, named "Wu" after his family name, told the Guiyang Evening News that his cousin's legs were covered in blood and mutilated.
The security cameras showed Yuan going to the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
Neither Yuan nor his cousin owned the pig that killed the man.
A manager from the market told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up so it would not attack anyone while officials were looking for evidence.
It was reported that Yuan's family and store managers are negotiating reparations for his death.
While it is rare, there have been previous cases of attacks by pigs on humans.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured.
Zahn Years earlier, a farmer in Wales had been pushed against his tractor by a 650-weight pig until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba-born farmer told NBC that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood is an "effective cause".
“They're just kidding each other.
These are little boys, extremely curious ... they won't harm you.
He explained, "You just have to treat them with due respect."
Much of the southwestern United States will suffer heavy rain from the foothills of Typhoon Rosa
As expected, Typhoon Rosa weakens as it makes its way across the cooler waters of Mexico's north coast.
However, in the coming days, pink will cause flooding throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States from continuous rain.
Rosa, a magnitude 1 typhoon, hit winds of 85 mph at 5:00 a.m. east coast time on Sunday morning and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
A depression is currently forming over the Pacific Ocean that is moving east to the west coast of the USA. On Monday, Rosa will move to the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, bringing deep tropical moisture north to the US Southwest.
On Monday, pink will cause up to 10 inches of rainfall in some areas of Mexico.
Afterwards, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching low ridge will lead to extensive heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
On site, 1 to 4 inches lead to critical flash floods, debris flows and perhaps landslides in the desert area.
Due to the low tropical humidity, rainfall sometimes reaches 2 to 3 inches every hour, especially in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in Arizona, a total of 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected.
The tropical rain, which is naturally scattered, leads to a rapid deterioration in conditions, and therefore flash floods can occur.
It would be very stupid to dare to walk into the desert in the face of impending tropical downpours.
Storms will create high winds and excitement in the area, and heavy downpours could turn canyons into swift rivers.
In some areas of the coast of Southern California, the low pressure area, which is no longer far away, results in local heavy downpours.
Smaller landslides with scree and slippery roads can be caused by rainfall of more than 1.27 cm.
In this area it would be the first rain shower in the monsoon season.
Monday night and Tuesday, rainfall will continue to spread after a few isolated tropical rains get closer to Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday.
It will rain heavily for a long time over the Four Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
If the Arctic cools, but the tropical areas remain warm, the tenth month can see sharp rises and falls in temperature across the United States.
In some cases this causes enormous temperature differences within small distances.
In the central United States, Sunday is an example of the dramatic changes in temperature.
Temperatures between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha and Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa vary by almost 20 degrees.
Within the next few days the sun will try again to warm up longer and more.
In the central and eastern United States, October is likely to be a mild start. In the Southern Plains to the Northeast, temperatures generally range in the 80s.
Temperatures in New York could climb to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would exceed the average by about 10 degrees.
Our long-term forecast suggests that the eastern United States will see temperatures above average in the first two weeks of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial has been watched by over 20 million people on TV
On Thursday, over 20 million people watched the Supreme Court Contestant Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford's interrogation on six television channels. She accuses him of sexual abuse, which is said to have happened in the 80s of the previous century.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate persisted and TV announcers kept pausing scheduled programs due to the recent U-turn on Friday: Senator Jeff Flakes of Arizona reached an agreement so that the FBI can conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford announced to the Senate Judicial Committee that she could safely say that an intoxicated Kavanaugh touched her and attempted to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh proclaimed with passion that this never happened, that he could say with absolute certainty.
It is very likely that over 20.4 million people, according to von Nielsen, watched the broadcast on Friday.
Average audience ratings were recorded by the company on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not yet available for other channels that had broadcasting in their programs, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In the case of people who watch in offices, Nielsen actually has to contend with a few obstacles in the evaluation.
The number of viewers is just as large as the size of the audience at a football playoff game or at the Oscars, to put it in proportion.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News Channel presenters, who had strongly endorsed the Kavanaugh trial, topped the audience rating of 5.69 million people during the trial, which lasted all day.
With an audience of 3.26 million people, ABC came second.
Nielsen announced: CBS watched 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Even after the negotiation, the interest remained unbroken.
Flake played one of the leading roles in the Friday drama.
On Friday morning, CNN and CBS videotaped protesters yelling at him while he attempted to take the elevator to a judicial committee hearing. This came after the Republican moderate politician's office issued a notice that he would vote for Kavanaugh.
When reprimanded, he fixed his eyes on the floor for a few minutes. CNN broadcast this live.
One woman said: "In front of you I am now here."
"Don't you think he's lying to the nation?"
Some have told him that the majority of women have no power while he is powerful.
Flake announced that his office had published a notice. He said before the elevator left that he would testify more at the committee's negotiation.
When it came to the judicial committee's vote on whether the Kavanaugh nomination would be passed on to the entire Senate to vote on, all radio and television channels had broadcast live hours ago.
Flake, however, said he would only do this if the FBI scrutinized the allegations against the candidate, which very few of the Democrats have requested.
What partly led Flake to believe were conversations with his confidante Chris Coons, the Democratic Senator.
Flake made up his mind after speaking to Coons and a few other senators.
The test would apparently result in Republicans counting more voters for Kavanaugh's legitimacy, showing that Flake's election had a huge impact.
The FBI is to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh on instructions from President Trump.
Great Britain's Prime Minister May blames critics for organizing “political games” to the detriment of Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics that the European Union is playing “political games” with Britain's future.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
Her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Checkers plan even more severely in another conversation with her, in addition to the one on the front page of the newspaper. In his opinion, the mutual collection of taxes between the UK and the EU was a "most ridiculous" idea.
Wayde Sims dies of gunshot wounds: Police take suspected Dyteon Simpson into custody as he is linked to the death of the LSU player
In the case of the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, a suspect is in police custody.
According to Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested for suspected murder and has been in jail ever since.
Video footage presented to the public by the police showed the battle between Sims and Simpson. During that conflict, officials said, Sims lost his glasses.
According to the CBS subsidiary WAFB, the police found glasses at the scene of the crime and said they had found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
After an interrogation, Simpson is said to have confessed, according to the police, to have killed Wayde with gunfire.
The legal side says his deposit is $ 350,000.
The reason for the death was a gunshot wound in the neck area, the East Baton Rough Parish Coroner's Office announced after an initial investigation.
The Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents are recognized by the Department for their contribution to the investigation into the arrest.
Joe Alleva, sports director of LSU, thanked the local police for "their careful work and their fight for law and order".
Sim's age was 20 years.
The almost two-meter-tall Forward spent his childhood in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne was also part of the LSU basketball team there.
Last season he reached an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
The team was "very concerned and stunned" by Wayde's death, said LUS basketball coach Will Wade on Friday morning.
Wade said, "You worry about that all the time."
It rained ash from the volcano on Mexico City.
In Mexico's capital, the ashes of the Popocatepetl volcanic eruptions fell over the districts in the south.
After activity on the edge of the volcano and 183 gas and ash emissions over the course of one day, Mexico's National Center of Disaster Prevention issued a warning on Saturday that no one should approach the volcano.
The center repeatedly found vibrations during surveillance.
The social networks published photos showing a light layer of ash on the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City as in Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since the quake in central Mexico in September 2017, which had a value of 7.1 on the Richter scale.
The volcano, also known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police officers and Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
At the celebration of the first anniversary of the election of Catalonia's independence, six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after a clash between independence demonstrators, riot police and counter-demonstrators.
The riot police stopped a group of supporters wearing masks. The masked people threw eggs and powder paint, creating thick clouds of dust in the streets, which would usually be crowded with visitors.
Frictions erupted that same day and police used batons to contain the clashes.
Singing “No forgetting, no forgiveness”, the independence demonstrators faced for a few hours those who demonstrated for unity with “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated with minor wounds sustained by the resistance.
The referendum that took place on October 1st a year ago was declared inadmissible by Madrid, but celebrated by the separatists of Catalonia. The unrest in the region, which is striving for independence, is clearly continuing a year later.
Although only a few went to vote, the majority of those entitled to vote opted for independence because a majority of those who opposed the split rejected the vote.
After the police tried brutal conflicts to prevent voting at polling stations across the area, the Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were wounded last year.
Some independence advocates set up their tents outside on Thursday night with the aim of preventing a rally in support of the National Police.
The rally took place, but it inevitably came to a different course.
In the eyes of the 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who attended the separatist resistance with his wife, the fact that Catalonia will become independent in the future is a hopeless matter.
"We spent one of our greatest moments last year."
He said: “I saw the moment when my parents cried with joy because they could vote. But now we are stagnating. "
Although the victory in the regional votes last December was decisive, but only just carried by it, it is not easy for Catalan independence parties this year not to let their fires go out because some of their most famous leaders have either opted for exile or are in jail. There they await the process that is to be made to them because of their activities in holding the popular elections and the subsequent declaration of independence.
In order to support the police, the mechanic Joan Puig (42) had filmed the resistance with her cell phone and said that the dispute had been stoked by politicians from both groups.
He said: "The situation is getting worse and worse."
Oriol Junqueras announced on Saturday that he would stand for election in the European Parliament next year. He is one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year.
He is of the opinion that the candidacy for the European elections would be the perfect opportunity to criticize both the dwindling ideals of freedom and the subjugation of the Spanish government.
Londonderry: Male suspects arrested after vehicle hits buildings
A 33-, 34- and 39-year-old were arrested after a vehicle was hauled into a residential building in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent around 7:30 p.m. UK daylight saving time on Thursday.
According to Chief Detective Bob Blemmings, damage to the driveways and the house was caused by himself.
It may be that the vehicle was shot at with a crossbow at the time.
Menga hit gives Livingston a 1-0 triumph over Rangers
First goal from Dolly Mengas brings triumph for Livingston
The risen Livingston caused astonishment among the Rangers and was the reason for Steven Gerrard's second failure in 18 games as coach of the club from Ibrox.
Because Gary Holt's team was in second place, the same level as Hibernian, Dolly Menga's goals made all the difference.
On Sunday, Gerrard's team will take on the leading Hearts, eight points apart, and hold out in this season's Premiership without an away win.
Rapid Wien will face Rangers on Thursday in the Europa League.
Since he was traded in for Kenny Miller last month, head coach Holt still tastes the failure. Meanwhile, Livingston extended his unmatched success phase in the league to six games.
Livingston wastes opportunities in the game against powerful visiting team
Their immediate attacks totally confused the Rangers. Therefore, Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored the first goal.
Scott Robinson shot through, but he knocked the ball past the goal. To take the head of Craig Halkett over the goal, Alan Lithgow was only able to guide his ball at a wide angle after it slipped in.
Knowing that they could confuse the visiting team in positional play, the hosting team happily welcomed the Rangers' game in front of them.
That way, the hit made all the difference.
The Rangers could not use a free kick. Livingston saw his chance in an open space while Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to prepare for Menga. He picked up the ball and landed a hit from the center of the penalty area.
The rangers were in possession of the ball much more often at this point, but they were unable to break through the defense of the host team. As a result, goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have to try hard.
Although Alfredo Morelos demanded that Kelly parry, it continued into the second half.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's thrust with his feet, and Lithgow quickly withdrew from another Livingston positional play.
Several crosses in a row were hit in Livingston's penalty area and parried there again and again, while two calls for penalties - after Halkett fouled once in a handball and against substitute Glenn Middleton - were rejected.
Unparalleled by Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A fantastic result for Livingston and an impressive performance.
During this upward trend, they continued to beat hope and all played fabulous without exception.
Holt deserves a lot of respect for the way he has held the team together since he started as coach, even if their style of play and the line-up have changed little since returning to the top league.
He had some role models.
Captain Halkett was first class and his defense was excellently organized. Menga team captains Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall also played extremely dynamically.
But the Rangers lacked ideas.
They did not live up to their usual level by any means, as excellent as they were under Gerrard in the meantime.
Only once did they kill the host team - the last ball was lost. For the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, this is something of a warning sign.
Reactions to Erdogan vary in Cologne
When the Turkish and German heads of government met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, September 29th, their faces were in a good mood and the sun could be seen in the sky.
The controversial visit of the Turkish head of state Erdogan to Germany, which was supposed to save the ties among the NATO allies, is drawing to a close.
They were very upset when the talks on topics such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan later traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
In a non-Turkish country, this city is the place where most of the Turks live.
For security reasons, the police wanted to prevent 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many fans wanted to see their president and therefore went nearby.
Hundreds of people - a large part of them were Kurdish - who protested against Erdogan, made sure that they were listened to when they denounced both the Turkish president's policies and the fact that Germany had decided to accept him here.
The conflict in the face of a visitor who is frenetically celebrated by a number of German Turks, on the other hand denigrated as an autocrat, is reflected in the demonstrations that face each other.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: Cyclist is killed when he collides with a car
A cyclist died after crashing into a car in London.
At around 10.15am BST, an accident occurred on a busy street in Deptford, southeastern part of town, near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets.
The driver got out, the paramedics took care of the man, but he was killed on the spot.
Approx. months earlier, a mile from the accident on Saturday, another road traffic accident occurred months earlier in which a hit and run driver was killed and a cyclist was killed on Childers Street.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials are in the process of finding out who the man is and informing the immediate relatives.
Drivers should avoid the area as roads are closed and buses have to travel different routes.
Long Lartin prison: Turbulence injured six officials
As the authorities of the prison announced, six officials were injured in a men's maximum security prison.
At 9:30 am BST, the HM Prison Long Lartin in Worcestershire experienced turbulence and continues to do so.
Eight occupants of a wing are involved and "Tornado" experts were called in to calm the situation.
At the scene of the accident, police officers received medical assistance for their minor facial injuries.
"Specially trained prison staff were deployed to get a grip on what is currently going on at HMP Long Lartin," said a prison spokesman.
Because six employees were injured, they were treated.
Violent activities are not allowed in our prisons and there is no question that those responsible will be handed over to the police and that their sentences may be extended. "
There are more than 500 prisoners at HMP Long Lartin, including a number of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison chief had to go to hospital for treatment after he was attacked by an inmate.
In October of last year there was an attack on the employees with billiard balls during threatening unrest, so that the riot police were alerted.
Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City at risk from flash floods from Hurricane Rosa (benefits for drought regions possible)
With the energy he still has, Hurricane Rosa is moving southwest across the desert and could cause flash floods, so by the beginning of next week Arizona will be hit by a tropical depression, which doesn't happen very often.
For western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah - including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City - the National Weather Service issued warnings of flash floods for Monday and Tuesday.
It is assumed that Rosa will move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and approaching rainy late Monday.
Since 1950, only "10 tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix still have tropical storm or low pressure status," said the National Weather Service in Phoenix in a tweet.
Hurricane Katrina in 1967 struck 40 miles from the Arizona border. "
According to the latest models from the National Hurricane Center, it will rain 2 to 4 inches and occasionally up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rockies and Great Basin, it will probably be 1 to 2 inches, in some places even possibly 4 inches.
Unless a lightning flood threatens you, the rain that pink brings could be extremely useful due to the drought that is causing suffering in the area.
As the south-west is currently experiencing drought conditions, some rain will probably be of use, although flooding must be taken seriously.
"The U.S. Drought Monitor states that a minimum of more than 40% of Arizona are complaining of at least a second level drought, ”reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa is approaching the land at the beginning and sweeps across the entire Baja California peninsula and Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Hurricane Rosa was still 85 miles an hour. It is currently 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and traveling north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
As the storm in the Pacific hits water that is colder, it becomes a little weaker.
It is then assumed to hit the mainland as a tropical storm in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Since the rain could be heavy in some areas of Mexico, there is a risk of major flooding.
According to weather.com, it is assumed that there is a total of 8 to 15 cm of rain in Baja California to northwestern Sonora, in certain locations even up to a possible 25 cm.
The hurricane will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm and arrive at the Arizona border as a tropical depression early on Tuesday morning. It will then move through northern Arizona and arrive in southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The National Hurricane Center stated, "The heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern deserts of the United States are believed to be the greatest threat that pink, or what's left of it, is."
One assumes life-threatening flash floods as well as debris flows in the desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas, which this rain triggers.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
A 16-year-old was found in Sommerset with stab wounds, so that a 20-year-old man and three teenagers were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
At around 4 a.m. on Saturday, the wounded teenager was found near Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton.
He was transported to the hospital and his position is "stable".
Avon and Sommerset police reported that four boys, one 17 years old, two 18 years old and one 20 years old, were arrested at Radstock that night.
The officers called on everyone to report if they recorded the crime on their cell phones.
Kavanaugh has seen how vicious and angry the Democratic Party is, Trump said.
Trump declared at a demonstration in Wheeling, West Virginia: "If you vote for Judge Kavanaugh, you are voting against the unscrupulous and outrageous practices of the Democratic Party."
Kavanaugh allegedly took with him "the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party while he was going through the process for his nomination, the American president said.
Speaking to Congress on Thursday, Kavanaugh frenetically and emotionally denied the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford who accused him of sexual abuse decades ago when the two were teenagers.
She also expressed herself when asked about her allegations.
On Saturday, Trump stated that "the Americans then saw how brilliant, excellent and brave Kavanaugh is".
In West Virginia, he told the many supporters, "If you vote for Judge Kavanaugh, you will vote for one of the most skilled legal scholars there is today, a legal scholar who does excellent public service."
Trump hinted at the Kavanaugh nomination while talking about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am, ”he explained.
"For this reason, I am on the road and do my best to find suitable candidates."
Democrats wanted to "stand up and set up blockades," the American president brought forth.
A senior adviser to the top of the Republican leadership told CNN that the first major Senate vote on how to proceed with the Kavanaugh nomination would be held by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds die in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, and more and more fatalities
Due to the strong earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island, numerous people were swept away from the water as the beaches were flooded with very high waves. 384 people died, government agencies reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu town on Friday to celebrate a festival when waves six meters (18 feet) high hit the island in the evening, killing scores of people and ruining everything in their way .
After a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, the tsunami occurred.
The spokesman for the civil protection agency of Indonesia BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a briefing in Jakarta: "Yesterday the risk of a tsunami was reported, people did not leave immediately, but stayed on the beach and died".
Nugroho stated that the tsunami washed away cars, wood and buildings, adding that the tsunami was traveling at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) over the sea before reaching the coast.
He explained that a number of people climbed trees in hopes of escaping the tsunami, and they stayed alive.
Around 16,700 people were relocated to Palu in 24 centers.
The aerial photographs published by the civil protection agency showed numerous ruined houses and shops, bridges that had been deformed and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the city on the coast was hit by subsequent tremors.
The earthquake series could be heard in an area where 2.4 million people live.
BPPT, Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency, announced in a statement that the severe earthquake on Friday was about 200 times as high as the energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
"With its geography, the town at the back of a long, narrow bay could have caused the tsunami to get higher," he said.
According to Nugroho, the losses were "considerable" and thousands of buildings, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He reported 540 people who were wounded and 29 people who were missing, and he stated: "Buried under the rubble of the collapsed houses, some dead victims were found".
According to Nugroho, it is possible that the death toll and damage to the 300 kilometers of coast in northern Palu could be higher. The Donggala area is not that far from the earthquake center.
Nugroho stated, "It was not possible to communicate or get information from Donggala."
The Red Cross took a stand and said that the area is home to more than 300,000 people. It also said staff and volunteers were on their way to the areas it hit.
It stated: "This is a disaster, but it is possible that worse things will happen to us."
On Saturday the authorities received a lot of criticism from everywhere for not providing any information about the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, whereupon the officials countered that the waves arrived at the same time as they were spreading the warnings.
In the videos shared on social media, a man can be heard shouting in desperation at people down the street from the top of a house for warning them of the waves that were coming towards them.
In just a few minutes, immense amounts of water rushed to the bank and washed away houses and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm whether the film recordings are real.
The officials found it difficult to organize the rescue operations, as the earthquake and tsunami led to a nationwide power failure, which impaired communication throughout Palu.
The officials said that the military had already dispatched cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other places, but that the evacuated people still lacked food and other basic supplies.
The city airport is still closed until October, it only opens its gates for relief operations.
President Joko Widoko was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
In Indonesia there are now more than 800 fatalities from the tsunami.
It is extremely bitter.
Mr. Doseba said that World Vision workers from Donggala made it safely to Palu City, where they gathered under tarpaulin covers placed in the courtyard of their office, but saw images of the destruction along the way.
He remarked, "They told me that they passed numerous destroyed houses."
It looks extremely bad.
At the time when aid troops were embarking on the uncomfortable task of initiating disaster relief measures, complaints were heard that aid workers from abroad with relevant experience had been warned about the trip to Palu.
Indonesia's regulations stipulate that the disaster site must first be declared a national disaster area before funding for supplies and the entry of aid workers from overseas can be approved.
It hasn't happened yet.
Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross, said: "At the provincial level, it is still a disaster."
"The moment the government declares this to be a national emergency, we can allow aid workers from abroad to enter, but this status has not yet been declared."
On the second night after the Palu earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of those still missing continued to hope that their loved ones would be among the miracles spread as encouraging news in the media during such cataclysms.
A young boy was freed from a sewer on Saturday.
Auxiliary workers rescued a woman on Sunday who had been trapped under rocks next to her mother's lifeless body for two days.
The trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandono, had trained two of the not yet found paragliders for the Asian Games, who had won in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mandagi said that some of his students were also among those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel.
He remarked: "As one of the experts in the world of paragliding, I am particularly emotionally involved".
Mr Gendon said he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to those attending the Beach Festival in Palu following the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse that was circulating among the paraglider community.
But he only saw a gray checkmark under his message, not two blue ones.
“That probably means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
When an ATM was refilled in Newport on the Levee, thieves stole $ 26,750
According to a headline in the Newport Police Department on Friday morning, thieves stole $ 26,750 from a Brink employee who was reloading an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in his report that the driver of the vehicle had stolen the money from an ATM in the entertainment center and was preparing for another money heist.
While the Brink employee was busy, another man "quickly approached him from behind" and stole one of the money bags that was to be delivered.
According to the report, eyewitnesses observed several suspects who fled and left the scene, but the police did not provide any information on how many were involved.
Anyone who can provide information about their identities should notify the Newport Police Department at 859 292 2680.
Kanye West: Rapper calls himself Ye now
The rapper Kanye West is renamed - he's now called Ye.
On Twitter, he announced the announcement of the change: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West has been called Ye for some time, and that nickname became the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where his new album will be presented.
The host of the show explained that he was coming in place of the singer Ariana Grande, who, because of "emotional motives", is not visiting.
A long time ago, West had stated that the word was not only an abbreviation of his current stage name, but also had a religious meaning for him.
Speaking to radio announcer Big Boy about the title of his album earlier this year, West stated, “As far as I know, 'ye' is the most common word used in the English translation of the Bible, and it stands for 'you'. , well, you '”.
“So I am you, I am we, we are meant.
"Kanye", which means "the only one", became simply "Ye" - i.e. it stands for what is good in us, bad in us, confused in us, for everything.
The album reflects who we are, so to speak. "
There are different rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
You can write the name of a former West employee, JAY-Z, with or without a hyphen or capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico vows not to use the military against the civilian population
In the run-up to the 50th anniversary of a bloody counter-attack against students in Mexico, the President-elect of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised not to use the military against the civilian population under any circumstances.
On Saturday Lopez Obrador guaranteed in Tlatelolco Square that "under no circumstances will military force be used to suppress the population of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, the military used firearms in a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing at least 300 people during a period when left-wing student groups were establishing themselves across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador had promised support for young Mexicans, on the one hand through monthly grants for students and on the other hand through the opening of further free public universities.
He explained that unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities make young people vulnerable to gangs of criminals.
The US should invest twice as much in AI funding.
The US should diverge its research budget for artificial intelligence because China is becoming more and more active in this area, said Kai-Fu Lee, AI investor and expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks came after several US government officials spoke out about artificial intelligence, even though the US does not yet have an official overall strategy in this area.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: China's goal is to be the frontrunner in AI innovation by 2030.
Lee said, "A good first step would be to double the funding for AI research given that all other nations are lagging far behind the US and the next big thing is being looked for in AI."
With a budget twice as high, the chance of the next big hit in AI in the US might be twice as high, Lee said in response to questions from CNBC this week.
Lee is the author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested money in one of the most important AI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player. He later served as a manager at Microsoft Research and as the president of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee praised technology competitions that the US government previously fought, such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's Robotics Challenge, and wanted to know when the next one would be organized so that new trailblazers could be discovered.
In the US, researchers are often required to put in a lot of effort to get government aid, Lee said.
Lee stated, "It is not China that attracts top scientists, but companies."
In the past few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have signed masters in their field from universities to continue working on Artificial Intelligence.
According to Lee, corrections to immigration policy could also be of help to the US in terms of AI.
He noted, “In my opinion, those with a Ph.D. automatically receive a green card in KI ”.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its AI Development Plan for the Next Generation.
Lee explained that the National Natural Science Foundation in China provides financial support for people employed in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government agencies that donate US scientists, but in China, the quality of the scientific work is not so tall.
At the beginning of the year, the US Department of Defense founded a joint AI center to work with partners from industry and business, and the White House announced the establishment of a special commission on artificial intelligence.
And DARPA this month announced a $ 2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
NSF currently spends over $ 100 million a year on AI research.
A US bill proposing the establishment of a national AI safety committee is on hold.
In a referendum, Macedonia votes on changing the country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people decided in a referendum on renaming the "Republic of North Macedonia". This step would be the solution to a decade-long dispute with Greece, which blocked the country's EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia, has insisted that the name of its neighbor in the north equates to a claim on its territory and has obstructed its EU and NATO accession.
In June, the two governments reached a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents said the change would affect the ethnic identity of the largely Slavic citizens of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and a boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether the vote would reach the 50 percent turnout required for a valid referendum.
The question to which the referendum is supposed to provide an answer was: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership if the agreement with Greece is accepted?"
Proponents of the new name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, justify the award as fair for efforts to bring Macedonia, which, like other countries, emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
Olivera Georgijevska (79) from Skopje said: “I am here today to decide on the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because in this way we can all have a safe life to be able to enjoy".
A sufficient number of MPs have announced that they will accept the result of the vote so that the decision becomes valid, even if this is not final.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be required for the name change to take effect.
According to an announcement by the state election committee, there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent of eligible voters had voted, compared to 34 percent in the previous general election in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
Gjose Tanevski (62), a voter in the capital Skopje, said: "I voted because of my children, we belong to Europe."
The Prime Minister of North Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zoria and his son Dushko on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, casting their vote for the referendum on changing the country's name. With this, the country could join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage with chairs in front of the parliament in front of the tents erected by the referendum boycott supporters.
Kavadarkov said: "We speak out for NATO and the EU, but we want to become proud members, not as if we asked for alms".
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity."
If we as Macedonia are not welcome, we can approach other countries such as China or Russia and get involved in the Europe-Asia integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, Macedonia, with its unemployment rate of more than 20 percent, would benefit from essential investments through NATO membership.
After Zaev voted, he said, "I think supporters will win big because more than 80 percent of our population approves of the EU and NATO."
In his view, a “yes” result would “affirm our future”.
According to a survey by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research made public last Monday, between 30 and 42 percent of voters would vote - less than is necessary for a valid referendum.
Another survey carried out by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV showed that 57 percent of the survey participants intend to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent intend to vote yes.
A voter turnout of 50 percent plus one vote is required for a valid referendum.
For the policy of the West-oriented government, a defeat in the referendum would be the first major setback since taking office in May last year.
Don't miss: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero leaves the entire Brighton defense behind and walks straight to goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton defense in Manchester's 2-0 win at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute just seemed incredibly easy.
Right at the beginning of the scene, the Argentine striker accepted a pass in midfield.
He ran around three Brighton defense attorneys and was then unstoppable.
Aguera was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made physical contact with a defender on the border of the Brighton penalty area and then left several others behind.
He then shot a pass to the left in the direction of Sterling.
The British striker used his first touch of the ball in the penalty area to play the leather back to Aguero, who shot the ball into the right side of the net for Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right boot.
City coach Pep Guardiola told the press: "Aguero is having some trouble with his feet."
"We had considered that he would play 55 to 60 minutes".
That is exactly what happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal at that moment. "
But it is thanks to Sterling that the Sky Blues had an edge in the Premier League game.
In the 29th minute it came to the goal.
Aguero took the ball deep in the Brighton half of the field in that game.
He shot a wonderful through pass to Leroy Sane's left.
Sane dribbled the ball a couple of times, then led Sterling toward the long post.
Just before the ball could roll off the field, the Sky Blues striker shot it into the goal.
The Champions League group game against Hoffenheim begins on Thursday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer intends to screw up the tour for the Rockies
In view of the Nationals from the Playoff race, there was actually no reason to force another start.
But the always willing Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on the throwing hill on Sunday, but only if this affects the playoffs of the Rockies, which have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
With a 5-2 win against the Nationals, the Rockies secured at least one wild card place, but continue to strive to win their first division title.
"Even if there is nothing in this game, we can at least play for the mood of the crowd here in Denver, and the opposing team would probably play as well as I have otherwise seen this year."
Why shouldn't I want to play along? "
There is still no information from the Nationals about their starter on Sunday, but according to reports they probably intend to let Scherzer compete at such a moment.
It would be the 34th start of Scherzer, who managed an upward tour on Thursday and who would pitch on Sunday, normally his day of rest.
The Washington right-hander has a score of 18-7 this season, an ERA of 2.53, and 300 strikeouts in 220/2/3 innings.
Trump speaks on stage in West Virginia
The President made direct reference to the situation regarding his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, when discussing the implications of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we have done is threatened.
In five weeks one of the most important elections of our lives will take place.
This is one of the most important, important ones - I'm not a candidate, but actually I'm a candidate, so I show myself everywhere and stand up for outstanding applicants, ”he explained.
"You see this terrible, terrible radical democratic group, you see it happening right now," said Trump.
And they want to regain power with absolute determination, using all necessary means; You see the wickedness, the treachery.
"They don't care who is harmed, who they destroy in order to conquer power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we will not leave them to them."
He said the Democrats had a mission to "refuse and wall."
“And that has been evident in the past four days,” he noted, describing the Democrats as “aggressive and spiteful and malicious and lying”.
Specifically, he named Dianne Feinstein, Senator for the Democrats and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, whereupon the audience booed loudly.
"Do you remember what her answer was?"
Have you published the document?
Um, uh, how.
No, oh no, just a moment - this body language was really bad - I've never seen worse body language. "
Labor is no longer the place for a wide range of views.
Those who express their views will not be tolerated
If the momentum activists in my local party wanted to punish me with their vote, it really did not come as a surprise.
At least I am the last of many Labor MPs to hear that they are not welcome just because we are expressing our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment for her tenacious position against anti-Semitism.
On the other hand, I was the victim of criticism in the motion of censure for not being in line with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy, the security of the country, Europe, paradoxically issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The message for the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday stated that “our encounters should be inclusive and fruitful”.
In my eight years as a Labor member on the ground, most of the Friday evening council meetings were exactly that way.
Unfortunately, the climate of many encounters today is not like that and the promise of a “nicer, more cautious” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever existed at all.
It became increasingly clear that contrary views in the Labor Party are not accepted and that all opinions are judged according to whether the leadership of the party considers them to be justifiable.
It started shortly after Jeremy took office as chairman, when colleagues who I thought shared similar political views assumed that I was going to make a 180 degree turn and hold views that I would otherwise not have endorsed. be it for national security or the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak out in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there is a shit storm on social media afterwards, there is talk of middle-class politics and I am told to quit the Labor Party.
And not only I experience it.
Of course I am aware that I am doing better than some colleagues, because the remarks addressed to me are mostly politically oriented.
I pay tribute to the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who are victims of an endless number of sexist or racist insults every day and who are never put off by it.
One of the really frustrating parts of this political era is how much the level of abuse has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labor Party to advocate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer such an all-encompassing church and that the more votes of no confidence or regulations to change the selection, the closer the party becomes.
In the past two years I have been advised again and again to duck and not speak my mind so loudly, then I would be "acceptable".
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since joining the Labor Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago - the reason for the near collapse of my entire classroom due to the indifference of the Thatcher government - it has been my intention to advocate better public services either as a community representative or as a government minister. for the people who need them most.
I never held back with my political stance, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have had any doubts about my political views and controversies with the current leadership.
To everyone who supported the movement on Friday, I would just like to say that if the country approaches a Brexit that will be detrimental to households, companies and our public services, I have no sympathy for the wish can devote my time and energy to loyalty to the Labor Party leader.
It is not the Nottingham Momentum that I want to address, but all of my constituents - Labor or not -: I am proud to serve you and I guarantee that neither threatened elections nor political expediencies will dissuade me to stand up for my beliefs on behalf of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, so far without defeat, sits at the top of the table
With two attempts shortly before the end, the final result was improved a bit, but Ayr was definitely the deserved winner of this wonderfully entertaining Premiership game by Tennent.
They are now the only undefeated team at the top of the table of ten teams.
In the end, the hosts won because of their excellent defense and better use of opportunities and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
He said: "So far we have been tested in all the games and we are undefeated so I have to be very happy."
"Respect for Ayr, you made more of your chances than we did," said Robyn Christie of Melrose.
Ayr took the lead when Grant Anderson tried to convert Frazier Climo on 14th minute, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, who does not appear in the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to score, and Jason scored Baggot took advantage of an untransformed attempt.
With a penalty, Climo extended Ayr's lead and then just before the break he was successful on his own and after the first half Ayr was 17: 5 ahead.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggot converted, brought them up to five points closer to the opponent.
Then play was delayed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the field, and after the restart of the game, Ayr extended his lead with an attempt by Staffor McDowall, which Climo changed.
The current Ayr captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and Melrose once again used the extra man in an unsuccessful attempt by Bruce Colvine that marked the end of an impressive series of attacks.
The hosts caught up again and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the tackle without the ball to Clima, MacPherson made it from the touchline with the ball past the advancing Ayr package.
Climo converted, as he did almost immediately after the restart, when Kyle Rowe accepted David Armstrong's endzone kick and sent winger Gregor Henry away for the hosts' fifth attempt.
Apparently, the Still Game star is about to start a new career in the hospitality industry
After it became known that Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named director of a licensed restaurant company, it looks like he's going to work in the hospitality industry from now on.
The player Jack Jarvis (56) in the successful BBC show, which he himself writes and of which he is the presenter side by side with his longtime comedy companion Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the show will end after the upcoming ninth season and it appears that Kiernan already has concrete plans for life after Craiglang.
The official records indicate that he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to say anything about the story, even if the Scottish Sun has information that Kiernan wants to have a say in the "successful gastronomy sector" of Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by land, is hoping for a decision by the court for renewed free access to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is covered by rigging.
A sea-blue flag is waving on public buildings.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon receive the motto: "According to the law, the sea belongs to us."
You have an obligation to save it. "
Enclosed by land, Bolivia longs to sail into the Pacific again, just as the memory of the stretch of coast that the country lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive.
Hopes have probably not been so strong for decades, because Bolivia will now find out on October 1, after deliberations that lasted five years, what the decision of the International Court of Justice will be.
Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat from Bolivia, said: "Bolivia has the momentum, there is an atmosphere of unity and serenity, and of course it is based on a positive decision."
All over the country, many Bolivians will wait for the ICJ ruling on big screens and hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia and, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia about a purely Bolivian access to the sea.
The charismatic indigenous Bolivian President Evo Morales - who awaits a controversial election campaign for re-election next year - also has many electoral districts for the decision on Monday.
At the end of August he promised: "Our return to the Pacific is imminent."
But there are analysts who assume that the court will probably not decide in the interests of Bolivia - and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not influence the outcome of possible negotiations.
Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile, commented: “The fact that the ICJ had taken a decision six months after hearing the final submissions shows that the case was“ not complex ”.
The last four years have not only failed to advance Bolivia's cause, but have possibly countered it.
Zarate said: "The current government of Bolivia has rushed to the issue of access to the sea."
Morales' aggressive language has eroded the remaining goodwill of Chile, she said.
In the future, Bolivia and Chile will start talks again, but it will be very difficult to continue negotiations after this incident.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors to the other country since 1962.
Eduardo Rodrìguez Veltzé, the former president of Bolivia and Bolivian representative in The Hague, refused to admit that the court came to a decision unusually quickly.
He noted: “On Monday, Bolivia will have“ a unique opportunity to usher in a new era in relations with Chile ”and the opportunity to“ end 139 years of disagreement in a way that benefits both sides ”.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains the most popular president in Latin America - used the issue of sea access for his political ends.
He added: "Bolivia will never waive its right to access the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision makes it possible to see that we have to let the past rest."
North Korea announces that it will only disarm nuclear power when the US has proven to be trustworthy.
Ri Yong Yo, North Korea's foreign minister, said North Korea will never take the first step in denuclearization if it doesn't trust Washington.
Ri gave a speech at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to keep the promises the heads of government of the two rival countries had made at a summit in Singapore.
It comes at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently trying to resume the stalled diplomacy on nuclear weapons more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "fantasy" that the sanctions imposed and the US rejection to declare the end of the Korean war lead to the North giving up.
Washington is reluctant to endorse the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes clear steps towards disarmament.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are in favor of another summit.
But there are still doubts that Pyongyang is actually prepared to forego an arsenal, which is probably the only chance for the country to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the coming month to begin preparations for a second Kim and Trump summit.
At fashion shows in Paris you can see the latest collection of oversized hats that find their way into large shopping bags in your area
If you need a new hat or don't want to give the sun a chance, stop searching.
On the runway for their summer 2019 collection, fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented the audience with a sizeable array of striking, giant hats that caused a stir in the usual world of Paris Fashion Week.
Hats that are extremely impractical flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers showed off their wonderful creations on the catwalks.
Valentino's top creation was a visor cap in beige with a feather-like wide brim that protruded over the heads of the models.
Other accessories that were much too big included decorated watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple - which, however, do not serve to keep the cold away from your head.
Thom Browne also showed the audience several strange masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the brightly colored masks had lips sewn on and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One model looked like diving equipment with a snorkel and goggles, while another looked like an ice cream cone melted in the sun.
And if you don't want to do without the oversized fashion statement, then luck is on your side.
Fashion connoisseurs expect that the giant hats could soon appear in your area.
The huge headgear immediately follows on from La Bomba ‘, the straw hat with a two-foot-wide brim that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski has worn.
The cult brand behind the extremely impractical hat, which is unmistakable on social media, has produced another creation - a straw bag for the beach that is almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that was holding it in her hand.
The raffia bag in brown-orange, which has a raffia fringed hem and is decorated with a white leather handle, was the eye-catcher in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jaquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
The star designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I assume that next summer huge hats and beach bags will shape the streetscape. Since the designer has created so much excitement, it would be difficult not to respond to the demand for the oversized accessories. "
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The Scottish Free Schools continue to be recognized for excellence in academic performance. In 2018 they proved this again with excellent exam results as well as individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other collaborative efforts.
There are over 30,000 students in Scotland and these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
The aim of the free schools is to equip their schools for further and higher education, the decision about their professional career and their position as citizens of the world.
In our education sector, which has the ability to create and implement a tailor-made teaching program, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired as electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela stated, "When you speak to a man in a language he knows, it goes into his head."
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes into his heart. "
This helps us to clearly realize that the English language is not enough if we want to create closeness and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's exams show that languages occupy top positions in the rankings and represent the highest success rates in independent schools.
Of the students who had foreign languages as a subject, 68 percent passed their Abitur with grade A.
The data collected in the 74 schools belonging to the SCIS show that 72 percent of the students received a top grade “A” in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students who study German, 63 percent of those who have French, and 63 percent of students who study Spanish also got an "A".
This proves that free schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as a core skill that is sure to be useful for children and young people in the future.
Private schools and other schools view foreign languages in their curricula as a subject on a par with science, technology, engineering, and math.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of employers cited a lack of language skills as one of the reasons why it was difficult to fill vacancies.
Therefore, foreign language skills are becoming more and more important for preparing young people for their professional future.
In the future, there will be more professions that require languages, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Foreign language skills are retained throughout our lives and represent a real advantage for the future regardless of the chosen career.
A person who speaks several languages and can communicate directly with people from other countries is far superior to his competitors.
A 2013 survey on YouGov of over 4,000 adults in the UK found that over 75 percent do not speak a foreign language sufficiently proficiently to be able to communicate in it. The only language with a double-digit number of speakers was French (15 percent).
Today's investments in language teaching are therefore fundamental for the children who are now going to school.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, have better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland each school teaches different languages.
In some schools the classed modern languages are in the foreground, while other languages such as Mandarin or Japanese are given priority, which are likely to be of the greatest importance to the UK by 2020.
No matter what your child is interested in, private schools will always have a wide choice of languages with teachers who specialize in their field.
Private schools in Scotland strive to provide children with a learning environment in which they are well equipped and equipped with all the skills to face the future.
It is undeniable that languages are fundamental to a country's future in today's global business world, so it needs to be reflected in education too.
In practice, modern languages should be classified as “international communication skills”.
Free schools will continue to provide such an opportunity, sophistication and quality to Scottish youth.
We must do it well.

On Sunday, LeBron will work for the Lakers for the first time in San Diego
LeBron fans have been patient long enough: The basketball player will soon be playing for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be in the preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes he will be on the field.
On the official Lakers website, Walton stated, "It will be more than 1 and less than 48."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would only play minutes.
At the beginning of the week, after training, James was asked what his intentions were for the six-game preseason program.
He explained: "In my career I don't need any preseason games right now."
Trump's Presence at the West Virginia Events, YouTube Channel.
Tonight, President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaign events in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five events programmed in the coming weeks that will bring Trump to Tennessee, Mississippi and other places where his supporters call home.
With the vote to confirm his candidate for the vacant position in the Supreme Court delayed for the time being, Trump intends to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans may risk losing congressional supremacy in November.
What time is Trump giving his speech in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it on the internet?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET today, Saturday, 9/29/2018.
You can watch Trump's performance in West Virginia online on YouTube live stream.
Presumably Trump this week will respond to the questioning of Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, which became sharper due to his alleged sexual misconduct and because of which the vote for his confirmation for the duration of the FBI investigation by up to one Week has been postponed.
But the main goal of these many appearances is to help Republicans who face failure in the November elections to make up ground.
According to Reuters, President Trump's campaign said that these five appearances in the coming week were intended to "give volunteers and supporters new impetus as Republicans strive to defend and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives."
A spokesman for Trump's campaign team, who wishes to remain anonymous, told Reuters: "The majority in Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible once this active campaign period begins."
The West Virginia News reported that tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling "could attract Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and Pittsburgh media reporters."
On Saturday, Trump visits West Virginia for the second time this month, where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is looking to back up Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patric Morrisey, who is behind polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, commented, "Morrisey finds it little reassuring that the president has come to get better poll results."
Ryder Cup 2018: Before the individual matches on Sunday, Team USA appears offensively so as not to give up hope.
After three unbalanced sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome may be just what the Ryder Cup was missing.
The idea of the swaying momentum pendulum is absolutely out of thin air for sport, but players really believe in it, especially at sporting events like this one.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were six points ahead and now four - I mean, that means a little momentum for us," said Jordan Spieth when he said goodbye for today.
With a lead of four points and 12 matches still to be played, Europe clearly has the upper hand.
However, Spieth said the US had felt a certain upswing. And there is a lot that can give them a boost, certainly the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three out of four points.
Spieth was consistently destructive and is a role model.
As he continued his round, in which he managed a decisive putt and thus scored an equalizer in the fourth match after his and Thomas ‘2-match deficit, these guttural excitement got louder.
His putt, which meant winning the match, was accompanied by a similar scream - a scream that leads one to believe that he expects another chance for the US team.
Spieth explained: "You really have to go into yourself and analyze your own game thoroughly".
This player no longer has anything else.
18 holes to impress
Apart from Spieth and Thomas, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points in the last two days, undoubtedly the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but inspiring couple from Europe have four out of four and are doing everything right.
Only the “Moliwood” couple did not beat a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game and the way they win over the crowd is proof that Sunday is about beating them. There are probably no players for a European victory at Le Golf National, who would be allowed to win more than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Ideally, both at the same time at different holes.
But it is still too early to speak of European glory now.
Bubb Watson and Webb Simpson didn't give Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of the morning in a duo with Alex Noren, a chance.
The Spaniard and the Swede maneuvered themselves into a hopeless position through a bogey and two doubles on the front nine.
But on Sunday nobody will be there to help you.
Watching up close Fourballs and Foursomes is exciting as the couples interact with each other with recommendations they make, recommendations they don't, and the way strategies can suddenly change.
So far, Europe has been more convincing as a team and was clearly in the lead at the beginning of the final day, but this four-man session also made it clear that the US team is nervously enduring a fight, which some, especially Stateside, had not believed.
Europe starts the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe started with a reassuring lead after the USA had to admit defeat 10: 6 in the fourballs and foursomes competition on Saturday.
The brilliant couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two wins against Tiger Woods, who had great difficulty, and thus achieved four points at Le Golf National for the time being.
Thomas Bjorns' European team, who want to regain the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, left a weak US team with little chance in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
In the Foursomes, the Americans offered greater resistance and won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team has to collect eight points in the 12 individual matches on Sunday to secure the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to win four points in a row, with Molinari, nicknamed "Moliwood" after a fantastic weekend, only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in their four opening games.
After a clear victory over Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they went one better and beat an inconsistent Woods and then the US rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more clearly with 5 & 4.
Woods was rather hesitant in two games on Saturday, albeit with some brilliant actions, but has now lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursome mode, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play at the Fourballs in the morning, was back in action in the duo with Henrik Stension in the foursome and won 2-1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - first and third on the world's best list.
But Europe didn't make it all on this beautiful, windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the majors three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They managed a close 2 & 1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in the fourballs and later they won in the fours against Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 after losing on the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team caught up after a four-point deficit at the beginning of the singles, even if a draw is enough for Furyk's team to defend the cup.
After being in second place for two days, a counter-attack on Sunday appears to be out of their reach.
North Korea declares that without trust, it will by no means unilaterally disarm
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions heightened distrust of the US and that North Korea would never carry out unilateral denuclearization under these conditions.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had implemented “important accommodating measures” last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging to end nuclear armament and technology.
He remarked: "But we are not seeing a similar reaction from the US".
"Without trust in the US, we do not trust our national security, and in this situation we will never be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's usual complaints that Washington refuses to accept "gradual" denuclearization that honors every step North Korea takes, his statement seemed relevant because it did not unilaterally denuclearize as Pyongyang has done so far had, basically excluded.
Ri mentioned a joint statement by Kom Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a ruling American president and a head of state of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had pledged to campaign for “North Korea's nuclear disarmament” while Trump gave guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea's goal was the formal end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US demanded that North Korea abandon nuclear weapons beforehand.
Washington also rejected calls for the strict international sanctions against North Korea to be relaxed.
Ri remarked: “The US is calling for“ prior nuclear disarmament ”and is increasing the pressure with sanctions so that it can absolutely achieve its goal and even achieve that“ the end of the war ”is proclaimed.
“To believe that sanctions would make us weak is an illusion of people who do not understand us at all.
But it is problematic because the ongoing sanctions lead to an increase in our mistrust. "
Ri did not speak about a second summit by Kim and Trump, which the US president underlined at the UN meeting earlier this week.
The minister, on the other hand, emphasized the three meetings in the past five months between Kim and North Korean Prime Minister Moon Jae-in, adding: “If we had to negotiate denuclearization with South Korea and not with the US, then the denuclearization of North Korea would not be so stuck. "
However, Ri used a different tone in his address than last year when he had told the UN General Assembly that the orientation of North Korean missiles against the US mainland was without alternative after President Trump, also called “Mr. Evil ”, called Kim as a suicidal“ rocket builder ”.
After threats of “total annihilation” of North Korea in the last year, Trump found many words of praise for Kim this year and praised his courage to initiate disarmament. But he also noted that there was still a lot to be done and that the sanctions could not be lifted until North Korea completely abandons its nuclear program.
Trump explained on Wednesday that he would not commit himself to a time and said: "It does not matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
Russia and China believe the UN Security Council should show respect to North Korea for the actions it has taken.
The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "We must firmly maintain the sanctions of the Security Council until a complete, final, verified denuclearization takes place."
Since 2006, the Security Council has tightened sanctions against Pyongyang in order to limit North Korea's funds for its nuclear and ballistic missile program.
On the occasion of the UN General Assembly, Pompeo spoke to Ri and said after the meeting that he would travel to South Korea again in the next few months to initiate steps for another summit meeting.
Pompeo has already been to North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not marked by success.
In July, when he left North Korea, he announced that steps had been taken. Thereupon Pyongyang criticized him after only a few hours for his "misplaced expectations".
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, Pyongyang promised to shut down a missile site and nuclear facility if the US took “appropriate action”.
He said Kim had explained to him that the "reasonable measures" he expected were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and that the situation would result in a harmonization of relations with Washington.
Harvard University students learn how to rest
This year, a new lecture at Harvard University gave all students the chance to get more sleep in order to counter the growing macho culture that caffeine-stimulated students don't close their eyes at night.
A lecturer at the university noted that students at top universities around the world often have no idea how to best look after themselves, take care of themselves, and be their own mentor.
Professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital Charles Czeisler developed the concept for the course, which, to his knowledge, did not exist in the USA before.
He got the idea for the course while giving a speech on the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
Then a young woman came to me and asked: "Why am I only finding out now, in my final course?"
She said no one had made the meaning of sleep clear to her, which I found surprising, ”he told The Telegraph.
In the course, which is being offered for the first time this year, students gain basic knowledge of good sleeping habits and learn how relevant these are for good performance in academia and sports and that they increase general well-being.
Harvard Medical School psychiatry professor and executive director of University Health Services Paul Barreira said the university decided to introduce the course when it discovered that students were definitely getting too little sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes various interactive exercises.
In this section you can see a picture of a room in the dormitory. There, students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books, and learn how caffeine and light work and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of a fixed sleep rhythm.
Another section tells students how persistent sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then gives students the opportunity to assess their own daily routine.
It is clear to us that this does not immediately make the students behave differently.
But we believe that they have a right to this information - just as one has a right to know the health effects of smoking if one chooses to light a cigarette, ”added Professor Czeisler.
Noting that it was still a matter of culture to be proud of "a night without sleep," he added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students made the problem of sleeplessness worsen.
All students should have the "secret weapon" of getting enough and good sleep to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he noted - even to avoid gaining weight because lack of sleep sends hunger signals to the brain, which is why one feels hungry all the time.
A 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, Raymond So, assisted Professor Czeisler in course design and taught one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said he understood a lot through the course and was motivated to promote a course for the entire campus.
He hopes that soon all graduate students will be asking to be able to take a comparable course before enrolling at the performance-focused university.
According to Professor Czeisler, it would be good if students set an alarm clock when they go to bed and when they get up and they know about the negative effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt the biorhythm and thus make falling asleep problematic.
Livington beats Rangers 1-0: Menga with a goal brings Gerrard's team to their knees
When Dolly Menga scored a 1-0 goal, the defeat of Steven Gerrard's inharmonious team was inevitable and the Rangers suffered another away defeat.
The Ibrox side were hoping for their first away win since the 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's players caused Gerrard's second break in 18 games as manager, giving his team an 8-point -Drinking of the leading Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Seven minutes before the half-time whistle, Menga scored a goal and at no time did it seem as if the uninspired Rangers team could equalize.
The Rangers have now dropped to 6th place and Livingston has moved up to 3rd place, just behind Hibernian in terms of the number of shots on goal.
In addition, the Rangers may have to prepare for further trouble as the linesman Calum Spence had to receive medical attention due to a head wound. Apparently he had been hit by an object thrown at him from outside.
Gerrard replaced 8 players in the team that Ayr beat and so reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was bringing up the same Livingstone players who took a point from Hearts last week, and he was undoubtedly pleased that his well-prepared team was giving rivals no chance for action.
In terms of play, the Rangers were better, but Livingston used his scoring opportunities more effectively.
The doorbell should have rang after just two minutes after midfielder Pittman had a tremendous opportunity on a pass from Menga Scott in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but missed his target by far.
Keaghan Jocobs then played a long free-kick on Craig Halkett, the captain, but his team-mate Alan Lithgow, who ran along with them, shot the ball past the far post.
Control was taken by the Rangers, who, however, began to follow the principle of hope rather than belief in the last third.
Referee Steven Thomson turned down the re-speaking of the Colombians, who, like Alfredo Morelos, definitely believed that he deserved a penalty fifteen minutes after he and Steven Lawless crashed.
In the first half of the game, the Rangers managed to get through only two shots, but the former goalkeeper Liam Kelly with a header from Lassana Coulibalys and a weak attack from Ovie Ejaria almost failed and put him in a delicate situation.
Livi's opening game in the 24th minute may have had a less positive impact, but they should be entitled to straighten themselves up again, which no one can deny.
In the depths of the Jacobs, the Rangers were unable to cope with positional play.
There was no reaction from Scott Arfield when Scott Robinson got the ball from Declan Gallagher, who stayed calm and focused and tricked Menga with a simple shot.
At the break, Gerrard acted by swapping Ryan Kent for Coulibaly, and that move resulted in an almost direct change as the remarkable Kelly ran off his line to intercept the pass winger Morelos made.
However, the audience was still stimulated by Livingston's style of play and he could continue to inspire them while Lithgow and Halkett were catching one ball after the next.
The lead in the finals could have extended Holts' team, but McGregor held out against Jacobs before a Lithgow header came out of the corner.
Again it came to the situation that the Rangers substitute Glenn Middleon was entitled to a penalty because it came to a duel with Jacobs, but this was once again ignored by Thompson.
Almanac created the Geiger counter.
We now come to a page from our “Sunday Morning” almanac: Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, physicist, was born in Germany on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago.
The Geiger counter known today is a device that was invented by Geiger who tried to develop a method to record and measure radioactivity.
The Geiger counter has also become a symbol of popular culture, apart from its importance in science, which can be seen in the 1950 film called "Bells of Coronado," where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are not as convincing as cowboys -Scientists come over.
Man: "What the hell is that supposed to be?"
"This device is called a Geiger counter and is used to locate radioactive mine ores such as uranium," said Rogers.
By using these headphones, it is truly possible to listen to the effect of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Now it clicks really well!"
Shortly before his 63rd birthday, "Hans" Geiger died in 1945.
However, his invention of the same name still exists.
Thanks to a new cancer vaccine, the immune system is able to perceive cells that are harmful to health.
With a new cancer vaccination, the immune system can understand how it can recognize and destroy negative cells.
The immune system can be taught by a vaccine to interpret dangerous cells as part of maintenance measures.
When using the method, immune cells are withdrawn from the patient and changed in the laboratory.
Then they are able to find a protein that is often present in cancer types and are then reintroduced.
Research has shown the vaccine to be promising, with promising results in several patients with different types of cancer.
One woman tested the effects of the vaccine, which allowed the immune system to recognize harmful cells in the body, and learned that her ovarian cancer had not been present for over 18 months.
In this treatment, patients are removed from immune cells and then prepared in a laboratory so that they are able to consciously perceive the HER2 protein, which is present in most types of cancer. After this change, the cells are reinserted.
In Bethesda, Maryland, Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Institute reported that the results suggest that there is a hopeful and promising vaccination here.
Prof. Berzofsky explained that: "Different types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer are promoted by the HER2 protein."
In the treatment of one type of leukemia, a comparable approach was necessary, namely “training” the removed immune cells from cancer cells.
After his appearance on the late night series Saturday Night Live, Kanye West wore a hat with the slogan "Make America Great Again" by Donald Trump, which he followed up with a pro-Trump inflammatory speech.
It turned out badly.
On a Saturday Night Live broadcast, Kanye West made a lengthy appearance by expressing appreciation to US President Donald Trump and claiming to be a candidate in 2020, which is why he was booed by the people in the studio.
During the performance of his third song of the evening called Ghost Town, he wore a cloak that said "Make American Great" and then began to berate the Democrats and make it clear that he was behind Trump.
It has happened several times before that I have spoken to whites and they have asked me how I can support Trump even though he is a racist.
He replied, "If I was concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago."
In a satirical skit, which took place at the beginning of the SNL show, Hollywood star Matt Damin Brett presented statements by Kavanaug, which he had alleged in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee because of the sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford.
West's speech, with aggressive content, was not broadcast, but recordings of it by comedian Chris Rock were posted on social networks.
Whether West was thereby ridiculed by Rock is not entirely clear.
West also complained to the audience because he was severely beaten backstage due to his headgear.
You bullied me behind the scenes.
"If you have this hat on you shouldn't go outside," they said.
You picked me up!
According to the Washington examiner, he said, "And then they tell me that I'm" in the sunken area. "
“Do you want to see the tranquil place?” Continued West and said: “You are not in a position to tell me what I can do or what not to do when I am wearing my Superman cloak. Do you want the world to improve?
You should try it with love.
Although someone from Vaniety claimed there was no sound in the entire studio, the magazine reported that at least two of his comments were boos from the audience and that show members of SNL were starting to feel ashamed of what it looked like
Rapper Mac Miller, Ariana Grande's ex-boyfriend, passed away shortly before she had your performance, which is why West took over the show for her as an afterthought replacement.
When he performed the song I Love It, West was disguised as a Perrier bottle, which confused many.
Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, extended her support to West on Twitter, with the words; "Someone with a lot of courage: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR STANDING UP TO THE CROWD."
It was tweeted by talk show host Karen Hunter that easily West is just who he is, which is not a negative at all.
I have made the decision to oppose those who have negative effects on my people with their beliefs by not standing behind their "art" and not supporting them by buying their music or clothing.
Now he is redeemed.
They expanded the statement with: "We too".
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name and now officially wants to be known as Kanye West.
He was not one of the first artists to choose a new name and was the successor to Diddy, who was also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg, one of his rapper colleagues, was called Snoop Lion in the past, as was the music legend Prince, who also changed his name. First he decided on a symbol and then he called himself "The artist previously known an Prince".

The poisonous masculinity is attacked by Game of Thrones star Kit Harington.
In the violent HBO medieval series "Game of Thrones," Kit Harington became famous for his role as sword-wielding Jon Snow.
The 31-year-old actor has clearly put down the stereotype of the macho hero by saying that boys are often led to thoughts through roles like this that convince them that they only gain respect if they meet behave so badly.
Kim said in his interview with The Sunday Times Cuture that he believed something was wrong and asked how the #MeToo era can improve the problem of harmful masculinity.
It wasn't long ago that Kit married his film partner, also 31 year old Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones, and he confessed that he had "pretty strong" feelings when he talked about the subject.
“What mistakes we made with regard to masculinity, this is currently giving me very strong feelings,” he explained.
What were we men taught by us men in their youth in relation to current problems?
Because of its very masculine characters, television is partly to blame for the spread of toxic masculinity.
“What has been there since birth and what was he taught?” He said afterwards.
What makes boys feel and what do they learn when they watch TV or are out on the streets that they lead to special aspects of male existence?
That's one of the most important questions right now, I think, how can we redesign this?
Something seems to be going wrong for young men.
He assured in an interview that next summer after the end of the series he will not participate in a sequel or prequel to Game of Thrones, that he is fed up with battlefields and horses.
Kit will play the lead role in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West from November, the story is about a film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The best thing Game of Thrones brought him for him was meeting his wife Rose, the actor recently announced.
He said he met his wife through this series, which gave him a family and a life from that point on.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the revered kit character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
China reports a 14% increase in new cases of HIV / AIDS.
The number of Chinese people suffering from HIV or AIDS has increased by 14%, China said.
Health officials say there are more than 820,000 affected people in the country.
About 40,000 new illnesses were reported in the second quarter alone.
A change from the past can be seen in the fact that the majority of the new diseases were caused by sexual intercourse.
Recently, HIV has spread rapidly through infected blood transfusions in some areas of China.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health officials said the number of people infected with HIV that way had fallen to almost zero.
Year after year, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
A major current problem facing the Chinese LGBT community is the transmission of the HIV virus through sex.
Discrimination against LGBT people is widespread in China, despite the fact that homosexuality has not been a criminal offense since 1997.
One study, given the country's conservative values, suggests that 70-90% of men who sleep with men will sooner or later marry a woman.
Inadequate protection during sex in these relationships spreads a wide variety of diseases.
The Chinese government has promised access to HIV medicines for everyone since 2003 as part of efforts to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters characterized the publication of data by a Republican senator as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories" and denied them.
Someone on her team has posted personal information about the three US Republican Senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages, US Representative Maxine Waters claimed on Saturday.
The Democrat from Los Angeles emphasized that these claims are currently being played up by “right-wing extremist” experts and websites.
In a description on Twitter, Waters said it was falsehood about falsehood.
The home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah were also reportedly disclosed when the information was released.
During the Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, information surfaced on the Internet Thursday, released by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill.
The revelation came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that the source of the posts could be traced back to an IP address linked to Waters' office that published information from a member of Waters Personnel, according to The Hill, this information was obtained from conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState met.
Waters classifies the allegations as wrong and as holistic untruths.
The fact that information was leaked is said to have nothing to do with the member of Waters staff, because of these fabricated and hypocritical allegations, the personal data and the security of the person were at risk.
It is a flawed slander and pure falsehood.
Ari Fleicher, the former White House press secretary, like many others on the Internet, reacted critically to Waters testimony.
Fleischer wrote that it was an angry revocation.
The guesswork suggests that in order to be a member of Congress, she does not seem to have the appropriate temperament.
You shouldn't be upset in the event someone is charged for something that they did not commit.
Resistance is not allowed.
Questioning the plaintiff's cause is not tolerated.
No doubt they are balanced and in control.
Democrats criticize Judge Kavanaugh for appearing too angry during the hearing Thursday, appearing to investigate Fleischer Waters 'reaction to Democrats' allegation.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro also expressed his opinion on Twitter, who would like to depose Waters in the mid-term elections.
He tweeted that if it holds true, it's a big deal.
According to Waters, the responsible authorities and law enforcement agencies were informed of the false statements by their office.
Waters adds that the criminals who have been devastating and dangerous to all of their employees in their actions will be caught with certainty and will be held accountable by law.
According to film critics, the new Johnny English Man Only Live Three Times, with Rowan Atkinson, is said to be an energetic spy parody.
In addition to the resurrection of the action comedy series Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English - now more than ever, attention is now generally being paid to the effects of Brexit in new films with British accents.
Are the country's new export opportunities the ironic self-satire of how obviously bad we are?
Johnny English, obviously a British comic character for every non-English speaking viewer, meets the humor of people all over the world with his googly eyes and his rubber face, now he has the license to stir up trouble for the second time.
He adopts certain character traits from Clouseau and Mr Bean, but also reminds of the guy who only contributed a note to the title song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London, but of course remains the ridiculous secret agent in the end.
The character Atkinson, a traveler and international man of mystery who once played in the long-forgotten Barclayard TV commercials and left chaos, served as a character model.
There is more than one good moment in this last JE outing.
My favorite scene is when Johnny English approaches a helicopter in knight armor and his helmet bumps into rotators.
Since even "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible confidently work with elements of the comedy, the humor feels energetic and unnecessary, even though Atkinson shows his talent for body comedy.
The absurd mishaps of Johnny English do not match the originality of the silent film gags in the role of Mr. Bean, and the target group also seems to be the humor of children and not that of adults.
The fact that the UK is in serious trouble is a constant theme
A pitifully insignificant role for Kevin Eldon is that of a cyber hacker, who reveals the identity of all British agents on duty by hacking into the top secret web network of spies in Great Britain to the horror of the agent on duty.
While there isn't much to work with in the script, Emma Thompson does her best with the Teresa May-like character, for a Prime Minister who is a self-righteous and questionable person who is already facing a total breakdown suffered from political unpopularity, the climax.
Bringing someone out of retirement is their only option, according to their intelligence advisor, through the failure of all active spies on duty.
Several jokes build on the Johnny English School-of-Rock-like academy for espionage, in which you personally learn from him how to become an undercover spy.
English celebrates his reunion with his long-suffering sidekick Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller, when he is rushed to Whitehall for an emergency meeting.
Vicki Pepperdine plays the exuberant, hearty role of submarine commander, even if this is a slightly wasted role, showing how Bough is now married to the said submarine commander.
Despite misunderstandings, Batman and Robin meet the beautiful Olga Kurylenkos femme fatale by Ophelia Bhuletova in action at Her Majesty's Secret Service.
The sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims in the role of the charismatic tech military to be able to solve the computer problems of Great Britain and, among other things, dangerously casts a spell over the Prime Minister.
English causes absolute chaos when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house with the help of a virtual reality headset.This fun was preceded by a series of malicious jokes and rubbish, which, among other things, included a French restaurant disguised as a waiter on fire get stuck or cause chaos when they infiltrated the luxury yacht from Volta.
Due to the lovable and lively aspects, the whole thing is strongly reminiscent of children's television and it can be assumed that all the stops for this last segment will be pulled out.
extremely measured things.
Why the British film industry doesn't even give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent is a question I asked myself in the last and current Johnny English films
The plan that the British work for four days but be paid for five days should not be worked out by the Labor Party according to their own statements
The drastic plan of Brits working four days but being paid five days must be considered by Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party.
According to the party, the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution are to be paid out by company bosses through an additional day off for employees.
Employees would get the same salary as before but only have a four-day week.
Structuring the country in favor of workers and adapting to the economic agenda is the plan and the idea behind it, according to sources.
In order to be able to take advantage of the changing economy, the switch to a four-day week, according to the Trades Union Congress, is to be supported in the interests of the workers.
Reviewing the guidelines before the end of the year is expected, according to a senior Labor source, the Sunday Times reports.
The party's approach to bring the economy back into balance in the interests of the workers, as well as the party's global industrial strategy, fit in with the new plan of the four-day week, even if it cannot be implemented immediately.
Since the Green Party campaigned for the four-day week in the 2017 parliamentary election campaign, the Labor Party would not be the first to pursue this plan.
However, this plan is not fully supported by the Labor Party.
The party is not considering a four-day week because it does not conform to party policy, a Labor Party spokesman said.
To illustrate his idea of the socialist economic revolution, John McDonnel, the shadow chancellor, used the Labor conference last week.
The indifferent directors and profiteers of utility companies should in any case be removed from power, says Mr. McDonnell.
With the Labor government being able to take deductions through alleged wrongdoing, the Shadow Chancellor's plan is not certain that current owners of water company stakes will get all of it refunded.
The establishment of an Inclusive Ownership Fund, which spends 10 percent of the private company's equity to employees, which can save up to £ 500 in annual dividends, as well as the planning of the appointment of employees to the company's board of directors, were confirmed by him.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reported "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
Whether the results of the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh affect the support of the Republican senators at all and whether they could give up support is questionable, in any case, it is certain that a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court will be postponed for a week, if not even longer.
Scott Pelley and Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham were asked in a 60 Minutes interview broadcast on Sunday by a correspondent if their minds could change depending on what the FBI investigation revealed.
Kennedy was more approachable than his colleague from South Carolina.
Kennedy said this was obvious in his opinion.
I said at the beginning of the negotiations that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh. If
I asked him if he did after it happened and the allegations came out.
He was determined, resolute and explicit.
Still, it looks like Graham's voice will be unforgettable.
He said it would take tremendous allegations as he made his decision on Brett Kavanaugh.
Referring to Christine Blasey Ford, Graham commented on Dr. To Ford in that he doesn't know what happened but can tell with certainty, the board resolutely denied it.
None of the people she mentioned could verify this
His age is 36 years.
I can't see any further changes, he said.
Does the Global Citizen Festival have an impact on the fight against poverty and what kind of festival is it anyway?
The end of global poverty is the goal of the Global Citizen Festival that takes place on Sunday. The annual music event in New York has an extremely impressive line-up of artists.
Tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to see artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes in the seventh year of the Global Citizen Festival, but also to end global poverty in 2030, because this is the real thing Goal of the event
The Global Citizen Festival was created in 2012 through the Global Poverty Project, a worldwide interest group that has set itself the goal of fighting global poverty.
If they were not willing to pay for a VIP ticket, concert goers had to perform various tasks, such as volunteering, making a phone call or otherwise contributing to the goal of fighting poverty, to draw attention, in return the visitors received a free ticket to the concert.
With regard to the 12-year period that remains until the goal is to be achieved, the question arises how successful Global Citizen was.
Whether people are rewarded to a concert, effectively pursuing a meaningful action and honestly contributing to an improvement, or whether they are again people who think they are helping by signing an online petition or a tweet, also known as "clickivism", is the question.
More than 19 million measures aimed at various goals have been registered by its supporters since 2011, according to Global Citizen.
Promises and guidelines worth over $ 37 million and which will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030 have been announced by the heads of state who were allegedly encouraged by these actions.
At least $ 10 billion has already been paid out or funded through the 2018 actions scheduled for the group's 390 commitments and announcements.
Targeted funding is estimated to have an impact on almost 649 million people worldwide, according to the group.
The Power of Nutrition made a pledge to support Rwanda with $ 35 million to tackle malnutrition in the country after Rwanda received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen, an important commitment made through a partnership of investors and implementers based in Great Britain, whose aim is also to help children develop their potential.
During a live London concert in April 2018, The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told visitors that with the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens around the world, like the concert-goers themselves , the social injustice of malnutrition can be classified as the past of human history.
The government announced financial support for Power of Nutrition's project, which provides nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children after more than 5,000 interventions appealing to Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the group announced.
In response to what you think, how we can end extreme poverty, one of the most frequently asked questions on your website.
It will be a time-consuming and arduous journey, and every now and then we will fall and fail, replied the citizen of the world.
Yet we will succeed, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before our time, because together we are stronger.
This year's event in New York will be moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman, with artists including Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae.
According to the interior minister, Russian energy exports can be made more difficult by a blockade by the American Navy.
According to a quote from the Wahington Examiner, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke reveals that Washington will use the Navy if necessary, including in the Middle East, to prevent Russian energy from entering the market.
According to Zink's allegations, Russia's engagement in Syria, precisely where it is acting on the reprimands of the legitimate government, is just a pretext to open up new energy markets.
"Since they want to enter into energy supply contracts, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe, I think they are in the Middle East," he allegedly said.
And the official claims there are ways to start it.
“With our navy, the US has the ability to ensure that the sea routes are open. In an emergency, they order blockages so that their energy does not appear on the market under any circumstances, ”he explained.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the Consumer Energy Alliance event - calling itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He drew a comparison between America's approach to Russia and Iran, noting the approximate equality between the two.
When he described Russia as a "circus horse" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels, he said: "Iran and Russia have the economic possibility of using and exchanging fuels more or less".
When the Trump administration tries to support the export of liquid natural gas to Europe in order to replace Russia, the clearly cheaper option for consumers in Europe, the statements appear.
Representatives of the American government - including the American President Donald Trump - therefore want to convince Germany to leave the "misplaced" pipeline venture Nord Stream 2, through which Berlin is going into "captivity" of Moscow, as Trump says.
Russia has made it clear on several occasions that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which costs 11 billion and, at 110 billion cubic meters, should have twice the existing pipeline capacity, is pursuing entirely economic goals.
Russia argues that for purely economic reasons, the United States is so resolutely opposed to the venture and that it is considered an example of unfair competition.
Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September, “I think we share the same view that energy cannot be used as leverage and that consumers have the option should be able to decide for oneself who should supply them ”.
The American point of view was followed by German dissenting votes, who once again agreed to support the venture.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industrial organization, called on the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Germany and Russia.
The President of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Peter Kempf, said after recently meeting with the Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and the President of Russia Vladimir Putin: “I dislike the fact that a third state is interfering in our energy supply very".
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she will be concerned about whether she will run for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "think carefully" about running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren agreed to eventually run at a public discussion in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
According to a news item from The Hill, she said: “The time has come for women to come to power and straighten out the fragile government. As a result, it is necessary for a woman to be at the helm ”.
"I will think carefully about whether I will run for president when November 6th. is over."
Warren gave her opinion on Donald Trump, the President, "He's leading the country backwards, not forwards."
She said: "I am very concerned about how the American President deals with our democracy".
Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, strongly criticized Warren.
Warren stated in a tweet on Friday that an FBI investigation would certainly be needed before the decision.
However, in a survey on Thursday, it became clear that most of Warren's voters believe that she shouldn't run for 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe, 58% of "likely" voters in Massachusetts believe the Senator should not run for office.
Such a project is supported by 32%.
According to the survey, there is greater agreement with regard to the candidacy of governor Deval Patrick: 38% were in favor of a potential candidacy, 48% were against.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are among the other prominent Democrats who are under discussion for a potential candidacy for president.
He will make an official decision by the beginning of the year, Biden said, according to the Associated Press.
During Donald Trump's demonstration, Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSD.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident Monday night.
At a demonstration in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, she said, "My own son has to endure so much because of his return ... I understand how families feel about the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and other physical injuries suffered by our soldiers , face ”.
“They are not the same when they come back. They have been hardened, they are coming back and are wondering whether the service to the land of their fellow soldiers and aviators and every other military member is being respected, ”said Palin, referring to the war veterans and their son, whose arrest they were“ elephants in the Space ”.
Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett identified the offenses he was accused of and arrested for Monday in Wasilla, Alaska: domestic violence, assaulting a woman, frustrating domestic violence reporting and possession of guns when drunk.
18 states, revision of the new asylum policy is carried out by D.C. promoted.
New American policy denies asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence, against whom 18 states and the District of Columbia welcome legal challenges.
According to NBC News, representatives from the 18 states and the county filed amici curae (Friends of the Court) in Washington on Friday to help an asylum seeker who objected to the policy.
There was no disclosure of the plaintiffs party's full name in the Grace v. Sessions trial opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy.
American officials rejected their application for asylum on July 20. even though she stated that her partner "and his sons, who are brutal gang members" had mistreated her.
She was arrested in Texas.
The states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have great problems with gangs and domestic violence, which is why many apply for asylum in the United States of America. These are also the states whose lawyers supported Grace.
The 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals on the possibility of unregistered immigrants to apply for asylum because of domestic violence has been overridden with the new American asylum policy.
The new guideline "disregards legislation at the state, federal and international level that was valid for decades," as Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Columbia, officially announced on Friday.
According to the Amicus Curiae report, federal law states that "such a ban is against the rules that decisions on any asylum application must be made for each application based on facts and circumstances."
The lawyers also argue that the US economy will be harmed by the banning immigration policy because they argue that they often become entrepreneurs and “provide the workforce that is needed ".
Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions told immigration judges in June that people who are on the run from domestic abuse or gang violence should no longer be granted asylum.
When the regulation on June 11th Sessions said: "Those who have had to leave their homes because they are persecuted or fearful because of their race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or because they have spoken out politically will be granted asylum".
It has never been the aim of Asylum to remove all difficulties - or even just all serious difficulties - that people face every day around the world.
The clock is ticking: In Palu, attempts are being made to save survivors, while the search for them doubles the number of deaths
The situation worsened for those who survived.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said he was "extremely worrying" while taking solace to her young son, who had a fever, at an evacuation center in Palu, the completely devastated city.
“Every minute, new bodies are brought in by ambulance.
There is almost no clean water ”.
Residents could be seen going back to their devastated houses, looking at their belongings, which were completely soaked, and trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
All sorts of injured people were waiting in front of the Palus military hospital, where the patients were treated outside because of the strong aftershocks, including Dwi Haris. She broke her back and shoulder.
When he told about the strong earthquake in the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter, tears came to his eyes.
“We didn't have time to save ourselves.
"I think I couldn't get out from under the collapsed walls," Hari told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then it was quiet.
I have no idea what happened to her and my child.
I wish that you are safe. "
"Bullying and" propaganda ads "are alleged against China by the American embassy.
The US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to create public opinion after an official Chinese daily published a four-page advertisement in a US daily highlighting the benefits of US-China trade for both sides.
China denies Donald Trump's accusation that they are in the US congressional elections on November 6th. interfered. Earlier on Wednesday, the American President referred to the paid China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the highest-circulation newspaper in the state of Iowa.
American officials told Reuters that Trump's allegations that Beijing attempted to interfere in the American elections marked a new stage in Washington’s intensifying campaign to pressurize China.
Although it is part of everyday life for foreign governments to post ads promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which they have steadily increased each other's tariffs on imports.
The retaliatory tariffs on the part of China were aimed at the beginning of the trade war to harm exporters in states like Iowa, which were supporters of the Republican Party of Trump, as specialists from the USA and China explained.
"Beijing is harming America's workers, farmers and businesses," said Terry Branstand, the long-serving American ambassador to China and former governor who is a major exporter of agricultural products.
In the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad penned a commentary in which he stated that China is "now desperate for this harassment by advertising advertisements in our own free press."
Branstad stated that the Chinese government is benefiting from America's honorable tradition of freedom of expression and press by spreading its propaganda through a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register.
He said that here in Beijing at the newspaper kiosk at the end of the street you will not hear too many opposing voices and you will not take note of the true different opinions of the people of China in the face of Chinese economic developments, which are worrying. The reason for this is that the media are subject to strong repression by the Chinese Communist Party.
Although he did not give the name, he also wrote that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers is refusing the opportunity to publish this article."
Analysts are sounding the alarm that the Kavanaugh debacle will scare away women from Republican mid-term elections
Analysts are sounding the alarm that there may be backlash - especially female - in the upcoming midterm elections as large numbers of senior Republicans hold and defend Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual assault.
The prevailing feelings were very strong and the majority of Republicans are already officially saying that a vote should be pushed forward.
In an article published on Saturday in The Hill, Syracuse University Maxwell School Professor of Political Science Grant Reeher explains that such events cannot be undone.
Reeher said he didn't think it would be enough for Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to force the prosecution of FBI investigations at the last minute to reassure angry voters.
According to the Washington D.C. Newspaper said on Friday, senior advisor and national spokesperson for MoveOn, Karine Jean-Pierre, that women will always remember what happened before - they will remember it tomorrow, just as they did in November ”.
The Republicans in control of the Legal Affairs Committee decided to defeat Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey continues to nominate Ford's remarks. As a result, manifestants shouted in the choir on Friday morning: "November is coming!" As they marched in the Senate corridor, as Mic reported.
The independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site: "The Democrats will be infinitely excited and motivated".
“People claim it was already high; that's right.
Still, it could be higher, especially with feminine swing voters from the suburbs as well as younger voters between 18 and 29 years old. Despite their dislike of the president, they often do not vote ”.
Even before Ford publicly announced detailed allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said there could be backlash if the matter were promoted by the Republicans.
Former Republican National Committee chairman Michel Steele said earlier last week, according to a report on NBC News, "It has become a confusing mess for Republicans."
The head of Priorities USA, a Democratic polling group, Guy Cecil, told the broadcaster that “It is not just about the panel decision or the final decision or whether Kavanaugh wins, but also about Republican behavior regarding this issue and how they dealt with it ”.
Americans seem torn when it comes to who to believe, according to Ford and Kavanaugh's statements. Nevertheless, a little more follow the latter.
According to a recent survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents certainly or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35% say they certainly or likely trust Kavanaugh.
38% also said they believed Kavanaugh likely or certainly not told the truth when he spoke, but only 30% thought so about Ford.
According to The Guardian, following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, the sworn in Ford told the Senate Legal Committee that Kavanaugh molested her while drunk when she was 17 years old.
The Supreme Court candidate is said to have shown his genitals to Ramirez at a party during their study time at Yale in the 1980s, she says.
Google and Facebook are to be taken over along with the launch of a new Internet, as the inventor of the World Wide Web intends.
The inventor of the worldwide network, Tim Berners-Lee, wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google by founding a start-up company.
The latest project of the technology legend, the Inrupt company, emerges from the open source platform "Solid" from Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users have the opportunity to decide where the data is stored and who has access to which information.
“Inrupt wants to rule the world,” explained Berners-Lee with a wink in an exclusive interview with Fast Company.
With regard to the start-up, he said: “It has to be done now”.
"This moment is meaningful."
With Solid's technology that the app uses, users can create their own "custom online data storage" or a POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools can be located there.
It feels like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all in the same browser at the same time.
The user can decide for himself who has access to which information - this is an outstanding feature of the private online data storage.
The company describes this as “self-empowerment through data”.
John Bruce, the company's CEO, explains that the concept of Inrupt is to use resources, processes, and specific skills by the company to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berner-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a number of salaried designers who have been contracted to work on the endeavor, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have had the opportunity to create their own decentralized apps using tools from the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee explained that he and his crew would not negotiate with “Facebook and Google” about whether a complete change that would throw all of their business models into confusion from now on was necessary.
“You don't have to give it to us”.
Berners-Lee wrote in a media article published on Saturday that Inrupt aims to "provide commercial energy and an ecosystem so that the integrity and quality of the new network based on Solid is protected".
Berners-Lee organized the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994 and thus changed the Internet.
Berners-Lee has played an important role in the past few months when it comes to net neutrality.
Berners-Lee continues to act as the founder and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute, even when Inrupt is launched.
Berners-Lee also added that he was “very optimistic about this new age”.
Bernard Vann: Memorial for Victoria Cross bearers from WW1
100 years after the Church of England's only man of God received the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I, there was a celebration in his hometown.
The badge was awarded to Bernard Vann, Lieutenant Colonel "The Reverend" on September 29, 1918, when Bellenglise and Lehaucourt were attacked.
However, he never knew that he had received the most important military award in Great Britain, as he was killed by a sniper four days later.
His two grandsons uncovered a memorial stone during a march in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
The fact that the stone is presented exactly one century after his grandfather committed the award-winning feat is "a symbol of the most excellent way," explained Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren.
It was reported in the London Gazette that Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin, although it is said to have been very foggy on September 29, 1918 and they are said to have been under fire from field artillery and machine guns ”.
Afterwards he pushed to the line of the riflemen and "courageously" led the front forward. Then he ignited a field cannon without help and destroyed three of the military units.
Approx. One month before the end of the war, Lieutenant Col Vann was shot dead by a sniper from Germany on October 4th, 1918.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said that he “could never do justice to the deeds that his grandfather had done, which is, however, quite disappointing”.
After the parade was over, headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, his brother Dr. James Vann and he also put down a wreath.
"It is an honor for me to be able to take part in the march," said Vann. He also said: "How brave a real hero is can be seen from the help of many people".
MMA supporters stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but saw Peppa Pig.
Think about it: You don't sleep all night so that you can see the Bellator 206, which is occupied to the last seat, so that you are not allowed to see the most important event.
On Channel 5, Britain could watch the San Jose submission live all night, which consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main map.
With their encounter imminent, Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald warmed up at 6:00 a.m. when the program switched to Peppa Pig, which viewers were watching without being able to believe.
Since they stayed up until the morning for the argument, many were not delighted.
“That was something of a bad prank,” a follower on Twitter captioned the fact that the children's cartoon series was switched to.
Commenting on the broadcast, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator Dave Schwartz said: "We had to air the children's program because the law did not make it suitable for children at 6am".
"Exactly, Peppa Pig".
"So that people from the UK can watch in the future, the schedule will be revised," said Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator.
Coker said he believed that if he thought about the replay, it would probably be possible.
“It is however Sunday morning at 6 am and we will not be able to organize it until our Sunday morning, Monday your time.
However, we do our best.
You need to know that there were a lot of text messages, all of them unfriendly, floating around when the program was changed over there.
We tried to repair it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't like that - it was a government matter.
I can assure you that this will not happen again.
Instead of the 6 fights that normally take place, we will focus on 5. We tried to go beyond what the fans expected and we just went over it.
"The situation is deplorable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "less worthy" because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he had a motivation for his success: when he was little, he felt less worthy of everyone because of his sexuality.
The 24-year-old only noticed that everyone was different from him at secondary school.
He declared on the initial Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, moderated by Lauren Laverne, that he was working for homosexuals so that others could "hope".
He also said that having had a baby made it less important to him to win the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the woman who normally hosts the long-running show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley looked like an outlaw in Laverne's first program and he explained that he felt he was “worse” than all other children and adolescents because it was not accepted in society if one was into women and men.
"By feeling so inferior and different - emotions that still exist today - I ended up becoming more powerful and stronger, and so successful," he explained.
He did not want to disappoint anyone who should ultimately learn about his sexuality, and therefore wanted to show that he meant "something" as he explained.
Having won two Olympic bronze medals, he is now a very famous LGBT activist and benefited from his appearance at the Australian Commonwealth Games by calling on other countries to recognize homosexuality as legitimate.
He expressed himself because he had a feeling of happiness in being able to live openly without consequences and he wanted others to be "hopeful", as he explained.
"It hit me like lightning," said the three-time world champion as he developed feelings for a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - whom he met in 2013.
Last year Daley's wedding took place with the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him. But he explained that their different ages were never a problem.
“If you have to experience so much at such a young age” - At the age of 14 he took part in an Olympics for the first time, 3 years later his father died of cancer; it had been difficult for him to find a partner who was his age but had gone through something similar.
Daley's "complete views" changed in June when the two had a son named Ray Black Daley, he explained.
"If you had interviewed me last year, I would have only been talking about getting gold," he said.
"I'll tell you something: Olympic gold is not the most significant thing in life."
Robbie means Olympic gold to me. "
His then 40-year-old father Robert succumbed to a brain tumor in 2011 and his son's name is the same.
Daley stated that his father could not accept his death and, as one of his last actions, he demanded that tickets be organized for London in 2012 to be at the front.
He said he hadn't managed to explain to his father that he wouldn't be right at the front.
He explained, "When he stopped breathing, I held his hand, and it wasn't until he actually died that I realized he couldn't always win."
In 2012 - the year after - Daley competed in the Olympics and won the bronze medal.
He said, “As long as I've been alive, I've wished I could play the Olympics at home. You can't explain this feeling ”.
This was also the inspiration for choosing Heather Small's “Proud”, his first song, which he heard while preparing for the Olympics and which still made his hair stand up.
On Sundays, Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 AM UK summer time.
On Saturday, Mickelson, who is out of shape, was referred to the bench at the Ryder Cup.
If Phil Mickelson plays his 47th game at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, the American will succeed in setting a record, but he will have to work harder again so that this is not remembered as a "failure".
Captain Jim Furyk referred Mickelson, who, since he has participated 12 times in the event that always takes place every 2 years, is the record holder, for the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday on the bench.
Usually the five-time major winner is the center of the action, as he has performed many times for the United States, but he spent his time cheerleading and improving his range in the way he hoped to remove his troubles to be able to.
He didn't even have drives when he reached the top of his career, which is why the 48-year-old doesn't seem like a good counterpart for the narrow Le Golf National Course, as stray shots there usually await the penalty of the long rough .
In case the place is not scary enough in itself, Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the British Open winner who made no mistake, in the ninth game on Sunday. He has linked up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and they have won all four matches they played together this week.
How Mickelson does could be completely decisive if the Americans, who are four points behind at the beginning of the 12 individual games, start strong.
Furyk couldn't help but stated that he trusts his player.
Furyk explained: "He was aware of the responsibility he had to bear today, patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around me and protested that he would be fully there tomorrow."
“He's very sure of himself.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame and has been of great help to these teams earlier and this week.
I guess I hadn't imagined that he would play two games.
I had imagined more, but this was the course and we were of the opinion that this was the way that lay ahead of us.
As with everyone else, his goal is to be out there. "
Mickelson will break Nick Faldos' record on Sunday as he will have played more games in the Ryders Cup.
The Ryder Cup career, during which he never reached the peak of his individual performances, could be ended.
Furyk explained about Mickelson, who won 18 times, lost 20 times and drew 7 times, that his team had an advantage by being there.
He said, "He's funny, cynical, intelligent, likes to joke about other people, and is just a great guy when we get changed."
“I think the younger players also enjoyed trying to mess with him this week and it was exciting to watch.
"With him you get a lot more than just games."
Thomas Bjorn, the Europe captain, knows that significant leadership can disappear
The European captain Thomas Bjorn himself has learned that lead stories in the press shortly before the singles at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an annoying topic.
In 1997 the Dane made his debut in Valderrama. In this game, Seve Ballesteros' team was five points ahead of the Americans, but in the end could only achieve an extremely close victory with 14.5: 13.5.
Bjorn, pictured, said after watching the Class of 2018 5-3 win on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 win at Le Golf National that he kept reminding himself to a big lead in Valderrama, where they narrowly won, and in Brooklin, where they lost.
The course of events will therefore prove to me and all team members that there is no end in sight.
Tomorrow you will show 100 percent.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
There is no end in sight until the dots are on the display.
We want to hold this trophy in our hands and we continue to focus on this goal.
Right from the start I have stated that I will focus on my own 12 players, but we are aware of who our opponents are: the world's best players. "
Björn was delighted with what his team had shown on a difficult golf course and added: “When this comes down to it, I would never make a hasty decision.
Tomorrow it will look completely different.
Tomorrow we have to behave differently, because it's about individual performance.
When you're on the pitch with a colleague, that's great, as long as everything goes to your liking. However, if you are on your own, you have to really prove yourself as a golfer.
You have to give the players the following: Tomorrow you should give 100 percent.
“Basically, you leave your colleague alone and he'll probably also have the task of giving 100 percent.
Compared to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk is placing his hopes on the fact that his players will show a stronger individual performance than if they were two. Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won 3 out of 4 points and are therefore an exception.
Furyk had seen both cases himself on the last day: he was close to winning at Brookline before the European team performed the “Miracle of Medinah” and he still lost.
His response to captain Ben Crenshaw preparing his team for the final day in 1999 was "Every damn word I have in my head".
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games to play. Still, our goal is to get started quickly, as we did in Brookline and Medinah. "
These middle games are under a lot of pressure if there is still so much drive to do so.
Our boys are set up accordingly, just like in our imagination, because we want to perform a magic tomorrow.
The management of the present is incumbent on Thomas, who meets Rory Mcllroy in the top-class game. The other European players Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are in the ranking in the first half.
Bjorn explained to his individual selection: "I chose this male constellation because I believe that it is armed for the entire route."
New German warship postponed again
Local reporters said the youngest frigate in Germany's Navy was to be launched in 2014 as a replacement for the decaying warships of the Cold War. However, this will not happen until at least next year, as the systems show errors and the costs would increase like an avalanche.
The newspaper Die Zeit appealed to a spokesman for the military and announced that the order for the new lead ship for the frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class called "Rhineland-Palatinate" would only be given during the first half of 2019.
It was planned that the ship would join the Navy in 2014, but obstructive difficulties after it was delivered haunted the progress of the committed project.
In 2007, the navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg class ships to replace the decaying Bremen class frigates.
You will no doubt have a powerful cannon, a significant number of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles - as well as a little stealth technology, such as anti-ship missiles. B. Reduced radar, infrared and sound signatures.
The fact that they do not have to be serviced until later is another important feature: it has probably been made possible that the youngest frigates can be used for up to two years away from their home port.
According to the newspaper “Die Zeit”, the constant delays are intended to ensure that the new warships, through which Germany is to become a project power overseas, look old when they go into operation.
Last year, the tragedy surrounding the F125 frigate caused an uproar when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship into the fleet and sent it back to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
The return of a ship from the Navy after it was delivered took place for the first time.
On the whole, it was not known why it was returned, but the media in Germany reported a number of significant "errors in the software and hardware", so that the warship could not be used for combat purposes.
Deficits in the area of software were extremely decisive due to the crew of 120 sailors - barely half as many as with older frigates of the Bremen class.
By being overweight, the performance of the ship was reduced and possible future upgrades on the part of the Navy were limited, as was also shown.
The "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to weigh 7 tons, which is twice the weight of similar ships that were used by Germany during the Second World War.
The lack of hardware and the cost of the overall project, which is related to it, including staff training, therefore represent difficulties.
The planned 2.2 billion euros are said to have increased to a remarkable 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion USD).
Since warnings were recently issued that Germany's navy was weakening, the difficulties in commissioning the youngest frigates are extremely considerable.
Hans-Peter Bartels, the Armed Forces Commissioner in the German Bundestag, agreed at the beginning of the year to the fact that the Navy basically has “fewer and fewer ships that are suitable for use”.
The problem has grown over time, as old ships are no longer used, but there are no new ships to replace them, as the official explained.
He complained that the Baden-Württemberg class did not have a frigate that could be used in the navy.
The secret existence of bats is overheard by the national trust
The aim of a new study carried out on property in the Scottish Highlands was to uncover the ways bats use their surroundings when hunting for food.
The result is to provide information about how the extraordinary mammals that fly behave and provide an aid in providing clues on how to protect them in the future.
The study will look at researchers from the National Trust for Scotland at Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross, piped bats, mosquito bats, brown long-eared bats and daubenton's bats.
In order to record how bats behave throughout the season, special recording devices are placed in key positions across the property.
Mobile research is also carried out by NHS members and volunteers using manual detectors.
By evaluating the sound of the entire recordings, experts will find out how often bats call and which species behave and how.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a habitat report are created, with the help of which a more precise behavioral picture is drawn on the scale of the landscape.
Finding out which are the most important habitats for the bats and how each species uses them is the result that NTS conservation consultant Rob Dewar is hoping for.
This knowledge helps to find out the advantages of working in habitat management, such as creating green spaces, and to determine the best maintenance of forest areas for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, the bat population in Scotland and across the UK has declined sharply.
They are endangered by the impact on their sleeping places and the loss of their living space through construction and development work.
Another problem is wind turbines and lightning, as well as flycatchers and some chemical treatments from building materials and cats kept as pets that attack them.
Bats can indeed see something.
Their ears help them more than their eyes when they catch prey because of their hunting habits at night.
They use a method of echolocation that is well advanced and can thus locate deficiencies and obstructions in their trajectory.
Bats are seriously looked after by the NTS, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 acres across the state.
There are ten trained specialists who carry out examinations, inspections of the sleeping quarters and from time to time also rescue operations at regular intervals.
The association built the first and unique bat sanctuary at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to 8 of the 10 bat species that live in Scotland.
The property is the perfect area for them, said David Thompson, the property manager.
He explained, "We have an excellent area for bats here at Threave."
“We have the old buildings, numerous tree monuments and the entire great living space.
The fact that we work here and in their areas is very helpful for knowledge about their needs and for further development, because a lot is not yet known about bats.
He emphasizes the importance of looking out for bats before any maintenance work is carried out on buildings, as an entire local population could be destroyed if a single nesting area is accidentally removed, as this consists of up to 400 females and young animals.
Bats are protected and must not be killed, harassed, molested or their sleeping quarters ruined.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust Elisabeth Ferrell has asked the people to help.
"There is still a lot we need to learn about bats, and with many species in our home we simply have no idea what it looks like given their existence."
While lawyers are busy suing German magazines, Ronaldo denies allegations of rape
The allegations against Cristiano Ronaldo that he raped someone, he dubbed "fake news" and stated that people, by using his name, "wanted to gain advantages for themselves".
His lawyers had the task of suing the German news magazine “Der Spiegel”, which made the allegations public.
Allegedly, the striker who was on duty for Portugal and Juventus in 2009 raped Kathryn Mayorga, an American, in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel announced on Friday, he allegedly paid her $ 375,000 for keeping the event quiet.
Hours after the allegations became known, the 33-year-old Ronaldo addressed his 142 million followers via live video and said it was "fake news".
"Not, not, not, not, not."
In front of the camera, he, who has been awarded the Ballon d‘Or five times, explained live that "as you just said", it was "fake news".
“You want to advertise yourself with my name.
It's commonplace.
They want to be celebrities because they use my name, but that's part of my work.
I'm in a good mood and nothing worries me, ”the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing for charges against the "Spiegel" based on the allegations, since according to Reuters they "passed on personal assessments without permission".
The player is demanding compensation for the “non-material damage in the form of a sum that is appropriate for the severity of the offense, which has probably been one of the biggest violations of personal rights in recent years,” said lawyer Christian Schertz.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga retired to the player's room where he allegedly abused them anally, according to documents submitted to Clark County, Nevada District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo threw himself on his knees in front of her after the alleged event and told her that he would be an "honest guy" 99 out of 100 times and that once he would be dragged in the dirt.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having had sexual intercourse with her, but this was wanted by both.
Mayorga also claims to have seen the police and documented their injuries with photos. Afterwards, however, she agreed to an agreement outside of a court out of “fear of revenge” and concern about “being exposed in public”.
Due to her ongoing trauma from the alleged event, she now wants to cancel the settlement, as the 34-year-old woman explained.
Just before the alleged assault, Ronaldo wanted to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid and this summer he opted for a € 100m deal with Juve, the colossus of Italy.
Brexit: The UK will “always feel remorse” for losing automakers
According to Business Secretary Greg Clark, after leaving Europe, the UK would "always regret" abandoning its reputation as the world's top automaker.
He also said that the fact that Toyota UK had assured the BBC that it would stop producing at its Burnaston workshop near Derby for the time being if Britain had to leave the EU without reaching an agreement was worrying.
Mr Clark said, "We have to agree."
The Japanese automaker said that if there was no deal on Brexit, jobs could be cut due to the effects of the tariff delays.
At the Burnaston production site, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis were produced, almost 150,000 mobile vehicles were manufactured last year, 90 percent of which were sold in the rest of the EU countries.
Toyota's Burnaston General Manager Marvin Cooke said: "In my opinion, our company will cease production if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March".
Other car manufacturers in Great Britain such as B. Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover feared the lack of agreements regarding the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW z. B. announced that it would give up its small factory in Oxford during the first four weeks after Great Britain left the EU.
If a Brexit goes without an agreement, it can create supply chain problems, which is one of the most significant fears given what automakers say.
Toyota's production line is based on the “just-in-time” principle, which means that parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union to manufacture ordered mobile vehicles.
As the industry says, if there is a no-deal Brexit on March 29, parts could be delayed or missing due to problems at border crossings.
The company said that manufacturing would cease because Toyota did not have the ability to store more inventory than what would last for a day at its Derbyshire facility.
Theresa May's Checkers Plan was “precisely designed to circumvent such checks at border crossings,” said Mr Clark, in view of the future handling of the European Union.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today program: “An agreement must be reached. We would like to come to an agreement in the best possible way that enables us to benefit from the current success, but through which we can also use this opportunity ”.
"As recommended by information from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, we definitely have to manage to continue to maintain this successful supply chain."
It was not possible for Toyota to estimate how long they would not be producing, but the plant issued a warning that in the long term it was in danger of becoming uncompetitive due to further costs, which could lead to job losses could lead.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been with Burnaston for 24 years and is the company's Unite union leader, said of the growing concern of his members: "From my point of view, these jobs cannot be returned once they are gone."
"There is now a precise and serious elaboration on how to deal with the European Union in the future," said a government spokesman.
As the White House announced, the date for the conversation between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again.
The White House announced on Sunday that Donald Trump's extremely precarious meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein “could be delayed by an additional week” as the debate over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was still ongoing.
Rosenstein is responsible for overseeing the actions of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia, and the possible interference with the preliminary investigation by the president.
For months in Washington, the number one topic of conversation was whether the American president would dismiss the deputy attorney general and thus endanger Mueller's independence.
The New York Times announced earlier this month that Rosenstein said he had a microphone with him to record what Trump was saying and that he spoke of the chance to oust Donald Trump from office by the 25th Amendment to the Constitution Application found.
The article was denied by Rosenstein.
However, last Monday he almost intended to resign when he made his way to the White House, reports say.
Since Trump was in New York at the United Nations at that moment, a conversation was set on Thursday instead.
Before the interview was postponed as a conflict was to be avoided with the questioning of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and also Dr. Christine Blasley Ford, one of the women who allegedly molested Kavanaugh, testified, told Trump that he would "rather not" fire Rosenstein.
Trump ordered on Friday that the FBI should investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, so an entire Senate vote was postponed.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There is no scheduled appointment yet, we may have to wait another week as there are other issues at the Supreme Court.
But this will show and I will always be happy to keep the press informed. "
Some of the reporters would see it differently: Sanders has not spoken to journalists in the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace wanted to know why.
The reason there are so few press conferences isn't because she doesn't like the journalists making themselves as important as she said. However, she also stated: "I will not deny that they act as if they were important."
She then made the claim that Trump would have more direct talks with the press.
"No president has given as many Q&A sessions as he has," she said, adding, without showing any evidence, "We looked at the statistics."
There will still be briefings, explained Sanders, but “it is much better if the journalists can question the President of the United States directly than to talk to me.
“Our goal is to do this several times, and you have seen it many times over the past few weeks. This will take the place of the press conferences where you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States. "
The President of the United States periodically replies to the questions when leaving the White House or when he is part of an open meeting or press conference with visitors in high office.
Press conferences that he holds alone do not take place often.
This week in New York you could possibly see why that is so: In front of a gathering of journalists, his demeanor appeared unconcerned and sometimes strange.
Fears fueled by Brexit are causing the Minister of Health to write to EU workers at NHS Scotland.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff at the NHS in Scotland, expressing support for his country and the hope that they will continue to work after leaving the European Union.
Less than half a year before Great Britain leaves the EU, a letter is sent from the Scottish MP Jeane Freeman.
The Scottish Government has already confirmed that it will pay Settled Status applications for European Union citizens employed in their shared public utilities.
In Ms. Freeman's letter it read: "The deliberations on the exit between Great Britain and the European Union continued throughout the summer, the decisions are expected in the autumn of this year."
Still, the UK government was preparing for the possibility that they would leave without a deal.
I know these times are very worrying for all of you.
That is why I wanted to signal once again how important I consider the participation of the entire workforce, wherever its members come from.
Employees across the European Union and beyond contribute vital insights and skills to empower and improve the health care activities that help the patients and communities we care for.
Your homeland is definitely Scotland and we want nothing more than you not to leave us. "
After sustaining a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery.
Mike Organ of the Tennessean said the Tennessee State Tigers linebacker had to undergo emergency surgery because he sustained a head injury while playing against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
The injury occurred shortly before the first half was over, Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told the reporter.
Reed explained, "He ran to the edge of the field and then just kind of fell over."
After the coach and medical staff oxygenated Abercrombie at the edge of the pitch, they put him on a stretcher and carried him down for further examination.
Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, learned from a Tennessee official that Abercrombie had had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris went on to say that "no details are known yet about the nature / consequences of the injury," and that Tennessee State is currently planning to analyze when the injury occurred.
This marks the first season of Abercrombie, a sophomore redshirt player to play for Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
His overall tackle record for the season has climbed to 18 with the 5 tackles he made in the game on Saturday while he was still on the field.
Foreign buyers pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher stamp duty when purchasing property in the UK
That Corbyn made this decision will ruin the success of his campaign to recruit young voters.
The higher stamp duty is distributed among those who do not pay UK duties.
The UK Treasury Department plans to raise funds of £ 120 each year to help people who have no place to live.
Today Theresa May will announce that overseas buyers will have to pay a higher transfer tax when buying property in the UK and that any additional funds will be used to support the homeless.
This approach will be seen as an attempt to balance what Jeremy Corbyn successfully endeavored to achieve, namely promising cheaper housing options for young voters and engaging the well-paid class in order to recruit them.
Individuals and businesses that do not pay UK duties will have to pay the higher stamp duty, the extra income from which is intended to aid the government in its homelessness endeavor.
It is possible that the additional amount that is added to the current stamp duty, including the increased rates for second homes and real estate for rent decided two years ago, is 3%.
Reportedly, the Treasury Department makes up to £ 120 a year from this practice.
It is estimated that around 13% of new construction in London is bought by non-UK residents who are driving up prices. Thus, they make it more difficult for first time buyers to gain a foothold in the real estate market.
With so many overseas buyers, most of whom are not in the country, many regions of the country that are well-off have become deserted places, including the capital.
Just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut, this new ordinance is launched, designed to help young people buy their first home.
Because they buy land without using it, he accused major construction companies of keeping prices up for the land. He insisted that Ms. May abandon cheap housing quotas in order to address housing problems in the UK.
Mr Corbyn made some spectacular suggestions on how to reform the apartment issue, including being tied to a rental price and no further evictions if you are not at fault.
Furthermore, municipalities should have further rights when it comes to building new houses.
Ms. May explained: "Last year I described the dream of Great Britain, which I would fight to resurrect as Prime Minister: every new generation should be able to live better than the previous ones."
And that means our damaged real estate market needs to be repaired.
There will always be one door open to anyone who lives, works and wants to live in the UK.
It is just as difficult for hard-working UK residents to buy their own home as it is for non-UK residents or overseas businesses.
Too many people can no longer afford the dream of owning their own home, and the shame that there are no apartments is very real. "
"My greatest ambition is to be responsible for the management of Scotland," said Jack Ross.
Jack Ross, the Sunderland coach, says the highest he wants to achieve, be it at some point as Scotland's national coach.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is in third place in the first division, with 3 points difference from first place.
He brought St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season and then moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
“When I was a player, I wanted to compete for my home country.
A B-stake was all I got, ”Ross told BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
“In my childhood, however, I often saw Scotland in Hampden with my dad, and that never let me go, it always brought me back.
But I would only get this chance if I can record success in club management. "
Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were club managers at Sunderland before Ross.
He's not afraid of being the successor to these well-known names at this important club, said the former boss of Alloa Athletic; He had turned down previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment I feel successful when I can help a club back into the top division."
He stated that because of its organization and what it is capable of, the club must undoubtedly be in the premier league.
"It will not be easy for the club to move up to the top division, but I would probably only feel successful here if I manage to help them get there."
After serving on the Hearts coaching staff for 15 months and serving as an assistant coach at Dumbarton, Ross has only been pursuing his coaching career for three years.
He promised relegation candidate St Mirren that they would win the championship next season after helping them deal with relegation to the third division.
During his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical, Ross never felt as comfortable as he does now.
When he remembered taking the helm at Alloa, he thought it "was probably a turning point".
“Management is right for me and suits me better than games. I was absolutely convinced of that from the start. "
I've had some well-deserved highs, lived meaningfully and even if it sounds strange, I got along well.
It can be exhausting to play.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
Running the company feels right, even if I am still stressed and work too much.
Ever since I grew up, I've never felt as comfortable in myself as now, when I work as a manager, which is something I've always wanted to do.
The full interview on Sportsound can be heard on Radio Scotland on Sunday, September 30th, from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM UK daylight saving time.
According to a survey, Saturday at half past five is the perfect time to have a beer.
Restaurant chains suffered more pressure, while UK pubs made much more after past problems due to the summer heat wave.
The July figures show that restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, while pub and bar chain revenues rose 2.7 percent.
The month of June saw a 2.8 percent increase in pubs, which was also recorded in July, with restaurants increasing even more this month. The reason given by Peter Martin from the management consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, was that England took part in the World Cup longer than expected and the long, sunny weather.
In July the restaurant trade took even more, although it had already fallen by 1.8 percent in June.
With “like-for-like” restaurants performed much worse than pubs and bars in which one can consume alcoholic beverages.
Owners of restaurants suffered less damage from the sun than pubs with restaurants.
It gives the impression that going out for a drink is what people want.
"For the month, food sales in all bars and pubs decreased 3 percent, while beverage sales increased 6.6 percent."
"The results show us that the trend we have seen since the end of April is continuing," said one of RSM's leisure and hospitality analysts, Paul Newman.
In the out-of-home market, the most important criteria are still the weather conditions and the consequences of major social sporting events.
In addition to the constant pressure on prices, the reduction in sales of 4.8 percent per year is extremely painful, with which the restaurant chains continue to have problems, which is not surprising.
It remains to be seen whether the cooler weather in August will bring the restaurant operators relaxation, which was inevitable after the unsuitable, extended, summer temperatures.
The delay in the brand rollout can be seen in the fact that sales in pubs and restaurants, as well as new openings, rose by 2.7 percent in July.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker, which is used for the restaurant, bar and pub industry in Great Britain and gets its figures from 47 operating groups with a turnover of more than nine billion pounds, is considered a trustworthy performance target.
In social networks, one in five children keep secret from their parents that they have secret accounts there.
According to a study, one in five children, some of whom are under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that their parents and teachers don't know about.
The rise in fake Instagram pages was confirmed by a survey of twenty thousand secondary school students.
The publication of sexual content has been suspected in the news.
A fifth of the students said they had set up a “master” account to present to their parents.
Every fifth child has secret social media accounts that their parents don't know about.
A study of 20,000 students attending secondary schools, which resulted in more fake Instagram accounts, serves as information for Instagram.
The news reinforced the belief that sexual topics had been published.
One in five students said they had personal accounts and a muted “master account” that they presented to their parents.
A 13 year old girl has a secret bank account and when her mother looks at it, she sees that a teenager was trying to get others to "abuse this one".
The Rectors' Conference (HMC) of the Independent Schools and Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors found that 40 percent of the 11-18 year olds surveyed have two profiles, half of which admitted that one of them is used for private purposes.
Dozens of students are being tricked into finding opportunities online but parents and teachers fail to find them, something HMC boss Mike Buchanan finds very worrying.
On the board of directors of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle becomes the "Athlete Spokesperson".
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the board of directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive member of the board of directors at the annual general meeting of the board.
Chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who benefit from their valuable experiences in an international context over the past 10 years as Doyle is the best athlete in Scotland.
Beattie shares the view that by electing Eilidh to the Board of Directors, athletics in Scotland will be immensely beneficial as it has received tremendous respect across the athletics community in the UK, Scotland and around the world.
Doyle said she wants to speak for athletes and wishes to actually contribute and help promote the sport in Scotland.
After a brief circulatory disorder, the American, who won a total of four Olympic gold medals, including the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and who is now continuously performing as an expert on the BBC, was unable to walk.
He shared on Twitter that he had a stroke four weeks ago.
Running was impossible for me.
The doctors informed me over time that it will become clear whether I will recover completely or partially.
Today he is doing agility improvement exercises after recovering completely and relearning to walk, which was very hard work.
Big thanks for the motivating messages!
There are different opinions on the Internet about an advertisement for breast pumps in which mothers were compared to cows.
Opinions are divided on the Internet about a breast pump company advertising that contrasts cows being milked with nursing mothers.
In an advertisement for the launch of a new product, described as the world's first portable silent breast pump, the consumer electronics company Elvie shows a commercial clip with a wink, the idea came from a music video and it is supposed to show how free mothers feel when they are take milk with this new product.
"It's my breasts and not an udder, in case you didn't understand" and "You can't see a tail, but it's right that I milk myself" are excerpts from a song that was played by four experienced mothers in one dancing with a cow barn full of hay.
Der Refrain setzte sich fort: „Pump it out, pump it out, I´m feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I´m milking my ladies“.
There were differences on the Internet that were triggered by an advertisement that the company published on its Facebook page.
The video sparked mixed opinions, and out of a total of 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, many shared the view that the "atrocities" of the dairy industry are being portrayed innocently.
Using cows to advertise this product was a very wrong step.
One wrote that the big difference is that their children are taken away from them a few days after they are born, although they, like us, have to go through the birth and pregnancy.
The Elvie breast pump can be placed in the nursing bra so that it goes unnoticed. (Elvie / Mother)
One found that it is, logically, a traumatic experience for the child and the mother.
"The question is, what speaks against showing mothers in advertising who are allowed to keep their children to advertise a breast pump."
"This commercial has nothing to do with reality," replied another.
One woman admitted that she found the song "very funny" - so others were committed to promoting this.
"I think that's an incredible idea".
In the event that I was still breastfeeding, one would have been in my possession.
I feel like a cow pumping.
I accept the advertising, even if it's a little wacky.
One said it was an impressive product.
This advertisement is aimed at mothers who express milk (mostly in the toilet or at work), because they feel like “cows” when doing so, another contributed.
"This advertisement neither puts the dairy industry in a good light nor in a bad light."
When the video is finished, the women will reveal that they wore the inconspicuous pumps in their bras during the dance.
Many women feel like cows when they use the breast pumps, which the campaign uses as a basic idea.
When women use the Elvie pumps, they can move around, hold their children and be in public, thanks to the fact that the pump is silent, has no cables and can be securely attached to a nursing bra.
The partner and ECD at Mother Ana Balarin says "An offensive and provocative market launch is fair for the Elvie pump because it is such an ingenious product."
By comparing the dairy cows and the mothers who express themselves, we want to show the incredible freedom and all the challenges that come with it in a funny and interesting way.
Nothing new about the Elvie Pump is the headlines.
For designer Marta Jakubowski, a mother of two presented the product on her body on the catwalk at London Fashion Week.
Hundreds of refugee children were taken to tent camps unnoticed on the Texas border.
Strict statements and rules from Trump administrations have made it more difficult for sponsors to take in refugee children, which has not changed the number of monthly border crossings much, although the number of immigrant children incarcerated has increased.
Migrants are often afraid to take a step forward and take in children because they do not have any papers and fear that this will increase their risk of having to leave the country.
In June, the federal authorities announced that future, eligible sponsors, as well as other residents of the household of legal age, must take fingerprints, which will be passed on to the immigration authorities, increasing the risk.
Many people who tried to take in unaccompanied minors have been arrested by the agency, senior immigration and customs officer Matthew Albence told Congress.
Seventy percent of the people arrested did not have a criminal record, the agency later agreed.
Eighty percent of the sponsors or their household members are illegal in the country and the majority are foreigners who are criminals.
Mr. Albence announced that they would keep an eye on the people.
Officials created new rules, which consisted of the fact that children have to go to court after a month in custody at the latest, whereas before it was 60 days, which means that the children should be processed after a shorter time, according to information from employees of the contact point,
In order to speak out in front of an immigration judge for their legal claims, many take part by video conference call instead of appearing in person.
People who are not considered to be entitled to help should be deported as soon as possible.
Social workers and recent reports show that children are more likely to become aggressive or attempt to flee once they are under prolonged supervision, as it makes them feel insecure and desperate.
In the Tornillo facility, children's problems are not noticed, which is common in larger facilities, the representatives note with concern.
There is a risk that transporting children who are already suffering from trauma to the tent camp without enough space for emotional processing and saying goodbye to friends could provoke new trauma.
According to orders from the Syrian government, American, French and Turkish occupation forces are to withdraw immediately.
Even if there has been a war in Syria for eight years, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim calls on the UN General Assembly to send Syrian refugees back and also calls on Syrian refugees to return home themselves.
Foreign forces are unconstitutional in Syria because the fight against terrorism is not a legitimate reason, which is why they are treated accordingly, said Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister.
He told the congregation that "their withdrawal should be unconditional and immediate."
Since 2011, millions of people have left their homes and more than 360,000 people have died, leaving Moualem of the opinion that the "war on terror" in Syria is "as good as finished".
"The holy war will only end when all places in Syria have been freed from terrorist groups and other foreign, unconstitutional existences," said Damascus.
In the war against President Bashar al-Assad, more or less only Syrian-Arab and Kurdish armed forces are instructed and advised by 2000 United States soldiers in Syria.
The war-damaged country is occupied by a thousand French ground forces.
The conditions for the return of the refugees are good, said Moualem in relation to the refugee problem, but added that "a few Western countries are creating incomprehensible fears" aimed at keeping refugees away.
To make the return easier, he said she reached out to the international community and humanitarian organizations.
You treat this issue very politically, even though it should be purely humanitarian
According to the United States and the European Union, reconstruction aid for Syria will only become apparent once an agreement has been reached in the political debate between Assad and the opposition over the war.
According to UN diplomats, the agreement on a conflict-free zone in the rebel stronghold of Idlib has created the space to advance political negotiations between Russia and Turkey.
The planned attack by Syrian combat troops on a provincial town with three million inhabitants was prevented because Russian support was no longer available after the agreement between Russia and Turkey.
Despite the deadline of the agreement, Muallim emphasizes his hope that future military actions will be directed at jihadists, as well as the Al-Nusra Front, which is in contact with Al-Qaeda and whose destruction is foreseeable.
The UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the draft for a post-war constitution that should enable new elections will come about as soon as the first meetings of the new committee made up of members of the Syrian government and the opposition take place.
The new committee of the Syrian government will focus only on the review of articles of the current constitution, says Moualem, who also sets the participation criteria of the Syrian government committee.
The reason why Trump will start his second term.
Some liberal viewers hope that Trump's re-election in 2020 can be prevented by impeachment proceedings and polarizing scandals, even if his re-election is definitely possible.
It would undoubtedly be the end of one of the most exciting presidencies in history.
Exhausted spectators cannot be recognized so far
With 1.05 million viewers on CNN and 1.6 on MSNBC, prime-time viewer ratings have doubled since 2014 on CNN and nearly tripled on MSNBC.
MSNBC even has 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news from The Rachel Maddow Show, and according to Nielsen, Fox News four years ago during prime time was 1.7 million and now 2.4 million are watching .
In the ABC drama Designated Surviver, a cabinet secretary becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack, reports Neal Baer, the executive producer, and he also explains that this is a subject that fascinates people because they are cannot grasp it.

Before the 2016 election, she recalls a taxi ride in Boston.
The driver informed her that he will vote for Trump.
What is the reason? She said.
Mrs. Scovell said the reason was because he made her laugh, he reported.
Chaos can also be amusing.
Compared to other television programs, Washington's storylines would be perfectly capable of promoting the global health of the economy, the reunification of immigrant families, and the future of Roe v. To steer calf.

"Watching the sixth hour of an expert panel arguing about Bob Woodward's use of“ in-depth background research ”for his book“ Anxiety, ”Paul Manfort's $ 15,000 ostrich leather jacket, a garment that, according to the Washington Post, merely represents overconfidence and the consequence of Stromy Daniel's lurid description von Trump's anatomy exceeds the requirements of an informed citizen.

Although it was almost 27 degrees when I reached Mr. Fleiß's house, which is on the north coast of Kauai, he had holed up in his house, was watching MSNBC and was recording CNN at the same time.
Since Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Legal Committee, the opportunity to withdraw from the affire was superfluous, an uncertain future awaited him before the Supreme Court.
Mr Fleiss told me that he remembers how people said this is the end of western civilization when they were doing various crazy shows.
It turned out they were right, even though it was mostly a joke.
The authors of the memoir "Chasing Hillary" are business, politics and the media.
In the House of Representatives, money from outside flows in crystal clear races.
The realignment of the congressional electoral district brought two new incumbents into consideration, who are now competing for the same seat, so Pensylvanias 17th has a large inflow of money.
Last spring's notable election was won by Conor Lamb, originally from the redesigned suburb of Pittsburg, but won his seat in a different district.
Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th constituency, which overlaps vastly with the 17th constituency, competes against Lamb.
When it became clear that the old constituencies had been manipulated in the interests of the Republicans, the court decided in January to redraw the maps due to the unconstitutionality.
The dispute was sparked in 17 by the race over election campaign funding between the main bodies of party funding DCCC, also known as the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, and the NRCC, also known as the National Republican Campaign Committee.
In March, the popular by-election for the 18th constituency in Pennsylvania took place, in which Lamb made a name for himself with his narrow victory.
President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points, as Republicans held this mandate for ten years.
According to political experts, the Democrats will have a small advantage.
After considering the US about the disadvantages of supporting El Salvador against China, the decision was made to withdraw.
With only minor resistance from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, it became apparent to diplomats.
Despite the friendly meeting in June 2017 between Donald Trump and Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama, the Trump Group's management team was evicted from Trump's hotel in Panama.
In a statement earlier this month, Heather Nauert announced that following the decision to no longer recognize Taiwan, ambassadors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama had been recalled at the behest of officials from the US State Department.
In 2017, the country of El Salvador, against which sanctions are currently being considered, received USD 140 million for drug controls as well as development and economic aid from America.
High unemployment and murder rates were painful.
In order to discourage migrants from continuing to invade the United States, a conference focusing on security and economic progress as a result of a meeting held the previous year was convened by the North and Central American and official during the course of an internal meeting since the previous meeting had already taken place rated as progress in efforts.
In order to prevent any punitive considerations with certainty, high-ranking administrative officials make it clear that the conference should start in mid-September.
At the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, according to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence should clarify the importance of the government for a meeting in his speech.
Without sanctions or strict embassies from Washington, the three envoys returned to the Dominican Republic, Panama and El Salvador without a stir.
In contrast to the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal deliberations of the debate on condition of anonymity, a representative of the White House declined to do so on behalf of Mr Bolton.
An anonymous government analyst who was outside but in close contact was able to confirm the reproduction.
Academic career.
Through special investigator Robert Mueller, there seems to be clear evidence of Trump's obstruction of justice, so the next bad news may be imminent.
Whether there is any connection between Russia and Trump's campaign and whether there is any connection to the election attack is apparently being investigated by Mr. Mueller.
Even if Trump is currently ready to face the voters and, if necessary, a jury again, he may have to answer to the committee if the majority is shifted in Congress.
The fall of Trump and that of his counterparts in Europe is dependent on various factors and is in no way to be classified as foreseeable.
The duration of the effort is influenced by cross-continental decisions that have yet to be made.
If the West had sided with the Czechoslovaks in Munich in 1938 and had resisted Hitler, German officers would have been able to carry out a putsch against Hitler.
The resulting bloodshed could not be prevented despite efforts by missed opportunities.
The triumphal march of democracy accelerates or slows down through turning points in history which accordingly condense around these points.
Various such turning points are used to confront the Americans.
The man who determines the outcome of the Müller investigation, Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, could be fired by Trump, which will certainly raise questions about how to proceed.
Rosenstein's speculation that the president was incapable of office and that he was secretly admitted has caused him increasing difficulties since the press reported it.
The newspaper report in The Time is, according to Mr. Rosenstein, inaccurate.
The investigation into Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault and false testimony has been requested by the FBI and the Supreme Court will pass a judgment, in the event that the FBI's investigation is incomplete or fair or Kavanaugh is upheld by the Supreme Court, that is further Procedure unclear.
Whether a Congress will be elected by us that will hold Trump accountable after the mid-term elections is questionable.
If democracy fails in the current difficulties, hard times will be ahead of us.
I don't think we'll fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
The same Nazi regime that had occupied the embassy building I was living in at the time deported my mother, a Czechoslovak Jew, to Auschwitz.
Sixty years later, my mother, who survived Auschwitz and emigrated to America, gave me Sabbath candles which I lit with a swastika on a table.
This legacy makes it impossible for me not to be optimistic about the future.

Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Vienna from the Rangers.
If, after the remarkable tie in Spain against Villareal last month, the Rangers score a victory over the Austrians next Thursday when Rapid Vienna is visiting, the qualification from Group G of the Europe League is known to be foreseeable.
Graham Dorrans is convinced that the Rangers will mean a career upswing for him, even if he was eliminated after a knee injury and his first appearance of the season ended with a 2-2 draw against Villareal.
Since Villareal has an impressive flank, the 31-year-old classifies the goal as commendable.
We got away with one point, even though before the game we thought we could do something.
All in all, a draw seems to be a fair result, even if there was definitely the possibility of achieving even more towards the end.
We were the more capable team when we started the second half, apparently they were in the first part of the game.
Another significant European night is next Thursday.
I am convinced that with the considerable support of our fans we can get a solid result and move forward, although it will be difficult to get three points because their final result was extraordinary.
Given the changes the club has gone through and my injuries, the past year was certainly not an easy one.
The training is high quality and the boys enjoy their strong team
Leaving the past season behind us and carrying on with results, hopefully that will happen.
Retirement savings is a topic that women worry and fear a lot.
Only a few participants in the survey spoke with their family members about how they would like to be treated, even if all participants in the survey had clear ideas about it.
According to a nationwide data collection, the costs of long-term care are a topic of conversation in their partnership for about half of the individuals.
In contrast, only 10 percent discussed the topic with their children.
Holly Sinders, Vice President of Life Insurance for Nationwide notes that while people would like a family member to take care of the care, no arrangements are made to initiate the conversation.
It should start at this point.
It is not possible to seek family care unless this need has been discussed with the spouse and children in the past.
The type of care significantly determines the costs involved, which is why you should discuss this with your family and your advisor in detail.
Regarding your costs, you should contact your financial advisor who can help you get them covered.
A recognized long-term care insurance policy can partially pay for your long-term care and you get self-insurance with your own assets, depending on your financial possibilities.
In order to avoid legal disputes, you should work through your documents properly.
If you are no longer able to express yourself, you should ensure that a health care proxy is in place so that a trustworthy person can take care of your well-being and control the activities of the doctors.
In addition, a power of attorney for your finances should be considered.
In the event of your incapacity for work, a responsible person should take care of your financial decisions and your bills.
The idea that one of your elderly parents is hospitalized with a health problem should get you thinking about the little things.
Are you ready to answer questions about medications and allergies?
In order to prepare yourself well, you should put the facts in writing in a sorted manner.
That has nothing to do with money, but Martin asks himself who the doctors are.
Which drug treatments are possible?
Who takes responsibility for the dog?
This plan should currently apply.
In Ilfracombe, a man often shoots with an air rifle
While a man was making his way home at night, he was often shot at with an air rifle.
The 40 year old victim was shot in the chest, stomach and hand while in the village of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon.
The shooting, which took place at around 2:30 am BST, was labeled by police officers as an "accidental act".

Indonesia is shaken by earthquakes and inundated by tsunamis.
The Indonesian city of Palu was devastated by earthquakes and tsunamis on Friday, leaving 384 fatalities with the number rising, officials said.
Without working communication tools, helping officers were unable to get information from Donggala Governorate, the area north of Palu, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Over 16,000 residents were evacuated in Palu after the natural disaster.
On the island of Sulawesi there is a lot of educational information about Palu and Donggala.
On the west side of the island of Sulawesi at the end of a narrow bay is Palu, the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi with a population of about 379,000 people in 2017.
The tsunami and earthquake shake Palu as residents celebrate the city's 40th anniversary.
The government district of Donggala extends over more than 300 km over the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, the population of the administrative district, an administrative area under a province, consisted of around 299,200 people.
In the province of Central Central Sulawesi and especially in the coastal region of Donggala, the economic situation depends on agriculture and fishing.
Nickel mining is also very important for the region, but it is mostly focused on Morowali, the coast across from Sulawesi.
In the past 100 years, there have been several tsunami on Palu and Donggala, according to statements made by the Indonesian civil protection agency.
Hundreds of houses were knocked down and more than 200 people were killed in the 1938 tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, western Donggala was flooded by a tsunami, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently rocked by earthquakes.
Some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis in years are here:
Powerful earthquakes in 2004 caused a tsunami on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra, which flooded 14 countries along the Indian Ocean coast on December 26, killing 226,000 people, most of them in Aceh.
The west coast of Sumatra was hit by serious earthquakes in late March and early April 2005.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
On Indonesia's most populous island, almost 700 people were killed in a 2006 tsunami in southern Java, which was caused by a 6.8 magnitude earthquake.
2009: Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province, was hit by a 7.6 magnitude earthquake.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: On one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, around 300 people were killed in a tsunami with waves 10 meters high, which was triggered by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
2016: The Pidie-Jaya government in Aceh was hit by a light earthquake causing fear and destruction and reminding people of the terrible and devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
Over 100 people died as a result of the collapsed building, which this time was not caused by a tsunami.
2018: For the most part on the northern part of the Indonesian tourist island Lombock, more than 500 people were killed by a serious earthquake.
Thousands of buildings were ruined by the earthquake, which is why thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor and candidate for vice president, named Track Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, was reportedly arrested Saturday by Alaska State Troopers in Wasilla Alaska for domestic violence, which conflicts with a report of domestic violence and opposition to the arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone away from the female acquaintance while she was trying to reach the police to pass on the alleged crimes to her.
KTUU informs that Palin is in custody in Mat-Su on bail of USD 500.
The broadcaster reported that he was “definitely not guilty” in court on Saturday.
Palin could face a $ 250,000 fine or up to a year imprisonment for being assigned three Class A crimes.
He was given a day in prison and a $ 2,000 fine on charges on a Class B offense.
This is not the first criminal complaint against Palin.
He was charged in December for hostile attacks on his father, Todd Palin.
To report the alleged attack, his mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police.
The case is currently being processed in the Veterans Court in Alaska.
He was charged with domestic assault in January 2016 and is charged with possession of guns while intoxicated in connection with the crime of domestic violence.
His girlfriend was alleged to have injured her face.
Sarah Palin's son's violent behavior has been linked to PTSD resulting from his mission in Iraq, which has been criticized by a group of veterans.
Earthquakes and tsunamis left hundreds of deaths in Indonesia.
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Thousands of homes were destroyed in a tsunami caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
There was a failure of the electricity and communication networks, which is why the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was outside of central Sulawesi in the north of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The moment of the impact was demonstrated through videos that can be found on social networks.
Hundreds of people were surprised by a tsunami that struck the coast during a beach festival in Palu.
The suspect of the New York terrorist attack was unexpectedly voted in favor of the death penalty by the federal prosecutor.
Suspect Sayfullo Saipov, alleged to have killed eight people in a terrorist attack in New York, is believed to receive the death penalty targeted by federal prosecutors, a not-so-common sentence that has not been used for a federal offense in the state since 1953 was carried out.
To accomplish the raid on a bicycle lane off the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, Saipov, 30, used a Home Depot rental truck to run over cyclists and pedestrians.
To prove a death penalty warranted, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" caused them serious bodily harm, according to the letter of intent introduced in the Southern District of New York, to apply for a death penalty.
According to the court document, both of these charges are likely to result in the death penalty.
A federal court jury assigned Saipov a few weeks after the raid with a 22-point indictment - which includes eight charges of murder in aiding and abetting organized crime - normally used by the federal prosecution in organized crime and a criminal prosecution for violence and demolition of motorized vehicles.
Prosecutors described the manner in which Saipov carried out the attack as "ghastly, cold-hearted and hideous" and stated that the attack required an "extraordinary level of preparation and disposition".
The letter of intent states that “Sayfullp Habibullaevic Saipov caused suffering, harm and injury to the relatives and friends of Diego Enrique Abgelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco .
Five tourists from Argentina were among the fatalities.
The Southern District of New York has not handled a case involving the death penalty in 10 years.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug traffickers, but was given only life imprisonment in September 2009.
Most recently, the death penalty was assigned to the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in a federal case in New York in 1953, who two years earlier were convicted of joint espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were ultimately executed.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953 on the electric chair.
As is clear from court records, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, does not regret what he did days and months after his attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was happy with his act.
According to the indictment, Saipov reported to authorities that watching ISIS videos on his cell phone spurred him to carry out the attack.
According to the police, he asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room.
He advocated "Not Guilty" on all 22 counts.
Saipov's representative David Patton, one of the Federal Public Defenders, reported that they were naturally dejected after the judgment was made.
"We believe that instead of confessing guilt for life with no prospect of release, choosing the death penalty will ensure that the trauma of the incident is only postponed for everyone involved," Patton said.
In advance, the Saipov defense system had asked the prosecutor to waive the death penalty.
According to the Tory MP, Nigel Farage will be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations.
At a protest during the Tory Congress today, he promised to support "the people's army".
According to the past Ukip leader, politicians should feel pressure from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that the responsibility of negotiating with the EU be passed on to him.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Biringham that if Mr Farage becomes Brexit Secretary, the UK will come to an end.
Ms. Mays' problem that her hostile troops could not get along was compounded by the fact that several Brexit opponents among the Tories took part in an exclusive protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to pursue her Checkers compromise plan during the attacks originating from Brexiteers, Remainer and the EU.
Despite the Niederlange, Allies wants to continue to try to negotiate an agreement with Brussels in order to force the EU skeptics and the Labor Party to make a choice between their package and complete “chaos”.
Mr Bone wants to throw away Checkers, which he announced at the Leave rally in Solihull.
He advocates that Mr Farage will be appointed a peer and be given responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
We'd be out of it long ago if he'd had the responsibility, he said.
The MP from Wellingboroug added that he would mobilize Brexit, but that they would have to get rid of Checkers.
"We didn't wage world wars to allow ourselves to be humiliated," he announced to emphasize his opposition to the EU.
In our own nation we want to create our own rules.
Mr Bone dismissed the suggestion that the generally known view had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea is completely absurd that the English have a new view and do not want to leave.
Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory party's Brexit advocate, also joined the march, telling reporters, "I'll just say the Prime Minister should listen to the people."
The opposition will not vote for Checkers, as the general public does not like to see them, as well as our party and our activists, who cause us to be elected first by walking through the streets.
Start listening and get rid of Checkers, please.
Mrs May stated in a demonstrative message that: “Prime ministers will only keep their office if they do what they have promised.
Farage conveyed to the gathering that politicians planning to pursue the 2016 referendum decision should prepare for bitter resistance ‘.
He said, “It is now a matter of trust among the people and our political class.
“The fact that they are trying not to pursue Brexit leads us to tell them that we will not accept it and will not accept it.
In a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of not accepting Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We want to strengthen the country's people's army, which helped us to triumph at Brexit, and we will not give up as long as our United Kingdom has not developed into a haughty, self-sufficient and self-determined country.
Brexit opponents were meanwhile walking through Birmingham before gathering for a two-hour rally in the city center.
This weekend, several activists presented banners after the start of the group proclaiming Tories against Brexit it.
The Conservatives had security problems with a party app at the beginning of the conference, for which they were ridiculed by Labor peer Lord Adonis.
He said: “These are the people who tell us that they are able to put on all the technology for Canada plus plus for the perfect border and for free trade without borders in Ireland.
It's a nonsensical comedy.
He added that there would be no such thing as a “good Brexit”.
Warren wants to revise the candidacy for the office of president very thoroughly.
After the elections take place in November, the US Senator, Elizabeth Warren, wants to thoroughly review the candidates for the presidential election.
On Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a community forum in western Massachusetts, the Boston Globe announced.
In November, Warren, who has often viewed President Donald Trump critically, runs for re-election against GOP country representative Geoff Diehl, who was one of the co-chairs of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been largely speculated that she would be able to run against Trump in 2020.
Due to Trump taking office, the town hall format was used at the event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, which was their 36th meeting with the electorate.
She was asked by a participant whether she intended to run for president.
Warren replied that the time has come when "a woman should be at the top of power in Washington to put the demolished government back together properly."
Arrested for shooting fatally at LSU ledge.
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana reported that the suspect was arrested in the incident of the fatal shooting at LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
During a press conference at 11 a.m. local time, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting to help identify a man who could be recognized in the footage.
Early Friday, 20-year-old Sims was fatally shot while near the Southern University campus.
According to episode 247 Sports, Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday that "Wayde Sims died of gunshot wounds to the head."
To protect his friend, Wayde intervened and was shot by Simpson.
During questioning, Simpson confessed that he was at the scene with a gun and murdered Sims with it.
Simpson was arrested without incident and billeted in the East Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims came from Baton Rouge, was 2 meters tall and was in his third year of college and played 32 games, having 10 starts and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game .
Lewis Hamilton sees team instructions from Sebastian Vettel, which brings him one step closer to the world title and which gives Russia a great price.
On Saturday Lewis Hamilton qualified ahead of Valtteri Bottas and from that moment on everyone realized that the Mercedes team instructions would be an important factor in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start from pole position, almost letting Hamilton sit down and being able to hold onto his position for the first two laps, trying to challenge Vettel to attack his teammates.
It was felt to be very crucial that Vettel went into the pits first and let Hamilton drive into traffic at the end of the group.
After a pit stop one lap later, the Mercedes came out behind Vettel, but it came to a head-to-head race, whereby Hamilton managed to take the lead when the inside lane was reluctantly cleared by the Ferrari driver, which led to this Risk led him to have to hold the third turn after a double move in defense.
At the end of the first lap, Max Verstappen was seventh when he started from the back of the grid on his 21st birthday.
His goal was to overtake Kimi Raikkonen in fourth and to finish quickly, and during the race he managed to keep his tires under control
In the 44th lap he finally got into the pits, but he was unable to increase speed in the last eight laps and Raikkönnen finished fourth.
All weekend Valtteri did an amazing job and was a polite, courteous man, which made it a very difficult day for him when he was told to let me by.
"The team got a one two, which they expected with an excellent job," said Hamilton.
That was extremely poor body language.
According to Senator Dianne Feinstein, she failed to publish Christine Blasey Ford's letter indicting Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court contender, of sexual abuse, which President Donald Trump made fun of on Saturday.
During a meeting in West Virginia, the President made no statement in his speech about Ford's claims before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what happened in the Senate was that the people were "tactless, cold-hearted and hypocritical." are.
In the past few days he said he could see that there are a lot of people in the Senate who can be seen to be angry, mean, nasty and mendacious, that is a thing that can happen in the Senate and that is easy to observe.
The response to publication and disclosure is foreseeable that denial of accountability.
I wasn't
Do you remember?
Are you responsible for these revelations Dianne Feinstein?
I beg your pardon? You have to remember the answer, if you passed on information from the document
Absolutely not
I am not responsible for any disclosure
oh wait a moment
Imitating the senator, he added, we didn't let her ... absolutely not leak.
The letter of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, which leaked in September, reached Feinstein in July, but Feinstein denies that the letter had leaked through her office.
Feinstein speaks to the committee on the allegations insofar as he supports the allegations of Dr. The Hill reports that Ford did not hide it, but did not leak it either
I kept the matter secret according to your insistence, as it is a confidential matter.
During the ongoing event on Saturday evening, the President commented on the apparently not positively perceived revocation by saying that it was clearly a matter of poor posture.
While it's the worst posture I've seen in a while, chances are it didn't.
The president claims the Democrats are using the allegation against the candidate of sexual misconduct toward three women for their own purposes, continuing his defense on behalf of the candidate against the Supreme Court.
Restoring power was the first priority under all circumstances.
Mediaite reports that the president spoke up saying that the falsehood and spite were evident on their part and that they would not hesitate to hurt people in order to gain power and influence.
5: 3 is the current score of the Elite League Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants.
For the Giants, Patrick Dwyer scored two hits against Dundee.
In the second leg in Dundee, the stars of the Elite League undone their previous loss to the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win.
Due to the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants took the lead early on.
Before Dwyer could extend the Giants' lead, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the points for their home team.
Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their triumph and Francois Bouchard's equalization for Dundee could not prevent this.
After the victory of Adam Keefe's men's Elite Leaugue against Dundee in Belfast last Friday, in which they were able to level the 2-1 deficit, they suffered their third defeat in a row.
In the total of four encounters between the competing teams in the current season, the Giants had already won three games.
Kendall McFaul gave Dwyer the pass that led to the first goal in minute 3:35 and David Riutherford was responsible for doubling the lead four minutes later by passing it to Beauvillier.
Matt Marquardt equalized against Cownie in 16 minutes after Sullivan took the 14-minute lead with the home team despite a stormy opening period.
With the second goal from Dwyer towards the end of the first half, he secured the Giants the lead in the first phase of the game.
In the 28th minute Bouchard again scored the equalizer for the home team after they had switched to power play.
With the fifth goal of his team, Nielsen secured the victory in the middle of the last part of the game, which the team also owes to team members Cownie and Charles Corcoran, who helped put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game with their moves.
Next Friday Milton Keynes will play against the home team Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games.
Hundreds of people are able to escape the earthquake in an airplane as an air traffic controller was willing to sacrifice his life to save people.
After an air traffic controller died to ensure that the plane that was supposed to save hundreds of people safely lifted off the ground, he was celebrated as a hero in Indonesia.
After an earthquake triggered a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, many people are still missing and over 800 people died.
In the city of Palu, many people are stuck among the rubble, while the area continues to be haunted by strong aftershocks.
In contrast to his colleagues, the 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his position on the rocking control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu and did not run away for his life like the others.
To ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the tarmac, could take off with certainty, it did not move.
At the point when he thought the traffic safety tower was going to collapse, he decided to jump off the tower.
He died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, believes the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian news service ABC News.
The transfer to a larger hospital in another city will be carried out by a helicopter from Balikpapan, which will be made ready for take-off in Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, we lost it even before the helicopter reached Palu.
He added that it is heartbreaking to hear about it.
According to the national authority for disaster management, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited, and the authorities fear death tolls in the thousands.
Suptopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, assumes that the number of victims will continue to rise as dozens of corpses are still lying under the rubble and cannot be reached.
The city of Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was destroyed by waves nearly 6 meters high.
Supply measures and help come from military and commercial aircraft.
Every minute, the ambulances bring new bodies to light, Risa Kusuma tells a 35-year-old mother Sky News.
Pure water is limited.
Looting takes place in various mini markets.
The Indonesian Red Cross rushes to the aid of the survivors, but nobody knows what conditions await the rescuers, reports the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Jan Gelfand.
It could be much worse, but it has long been a tragedy.
The numerous tasks associated with the evacuation of the city of Palu are to be processed by the military day and night, this instruction was given by Indonesian President Joko Widodo when he arrived in Palu on Sunday.
CNN announced if they are done?
Over 550 residents of Lombock died in the earthquake that broke out in Indonesia earlier this year.
After a plane crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Air Niugini reports a person missing.
Although it was initially said that all 47 passengers and the members of the crew had left the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia unharmed, the airline now reports one person as missing.
The whereabouts of a male passenger was uncertain, according to an Air Niugini press release on Saturday afternoon.
In order to locate the man, the airline claims to be working hand in hand with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
When asked about further details of the passenger, such as their nationality or age, the airline did not respond.
After the plane failed while attempting to land at Chuuk Airport and crashed into the water, local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew.
Seven people had to be hospitalized for treatment, officials said on Friday.
On Saturday, six passengers, all in stable condition, stayed in the hospital, according to the airline.
It is still not possible to say what the exact reason for the accident and what happened.
The aircraft landed in the lagoon just before the runway, the U.S. Navy and the airline.
Several witnesses suspected the plane landed behind the tarmac.
According to Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, the landing approach of the machine was extremely deep.
Jaynes thought it was "a really great thing".
Jaynes and other passengers made their way through waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking machine.
He had a small wound on his head and panicked flight attendants were screeching, he said.
Before the aircraft went down in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water, sailors who repaired a shipyard not far away brought the passengers to the safe shore in an inflatable boat, reported the US Navy
111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes in the past 20 years, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of the crashes, according to data from the Aviation Safety Network.
An analyst interpreted the chronicle of a woman burned alive during the night
The prosecution resumed the case against a man alleged to have burned a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014 on Saturday.
For the news analysis, Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the US Department of Justice, was interviewed for several hours as an expert witness.
To piece together the movements, for the night she passed, of 29 year old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19 year old victim, Jessica Chambers, he showed the jury how he used cell phone recordings.
Contrary to previous statements is that Tellis died on the evening on which Chambers was with her. Rowlett recognized this from location data from various cell phones, the Clarion Ledger reported.
The police spoke to Sanford when the evaluated data showed that his smartphone was on Chambers' smartphone at the time he said he was with his buddy Michael Sanford.
When Sanford took the stand on Saturday, he said he was out of town that day.
"He lied because my truck was in Nashville," Sanford reported when prosecutors checked Telli's statement that he was in Sanford's truck that night.
Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died. This turned out to be another false statement.
According to cell phone records, the two had only known each other for a week.
"Tellis got Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information
deleted from his cell phone some time after their death, Rowlett explained "
According to Hale, he removed her from his life.
On Sunday the defense will begin to present their final arguments.
The judge expected the trial to come before the jury on the same day.

Another black man ?!
A couple was sued by a New York nanny for firing after texting them "racist". In a misdirected text message she had received from her mother, she wrote that she was "just another black person". As a result, a New York nanny sued a couple for dismissal on grounds of discrimination.
The couple compared the incident to "blackmail" and claimed not to be racist.
When the dark-skinned nanny Giselle Maurice came for her first day at work in 2016, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was appalled by the color of Giselle's skin.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband: "NEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIN, ANOTHER COLORED PERSON."
The message landed twice on Mrs. Maurice instead of her partner.
An "embarrassed" Mr. Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice after he noticed his wife's misfortune by suggesting, according to the New York Post, that the nanny was extroverted, dark-skinned and poorly worked and that she preferred to be her have a Filipino woman.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and was sent home by Uber.
Maurice wants the couple to receive compensation of USD 350 per day for the six-month stay for which they were initially hired, but without written confirmation.
"I know it's racism" and "Look, you don't do these things," she would like to tell them, she told the Post on Friday.
According to the couple, the dismissal was sensible because they were afraid that they could no longer trust her after being insulted. They also rejected the racism allegations.
"My wife sent her a text that she didn't mean."
It is not racist.
Husband Joel Plasco told the Post that he and his wife are not racist people.
Even if you were just accidentally rude to someone, would you trust them with your children?
Your just born baby?
Oh come on
Plasco defended his wife by saying she would have a baby in two months and she would be in an uncomfortable situation. He also compared the process to blackmail.
"Are you going to check such a person?"
The investment banker added that it was not polite to do this.
The couple have been publicly tackled on social media and have received harsh criticism of their actions and way of thinking while the legal case is in full swing.
Readers could not identify with a talking teddy bear, feared the editors of the Paddington books, according to a new letter.
"It is not easy to empathize with someone who is reading something for the first time before it was published," remarked Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, regarding the writing.
"What we know about Paddington's current success is very amusing."
Her testimony that her father, who was the cameraman for the BBC before he came up with the idea of writing a children's book about a little teddy bear, was confident that his work would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication " bittersweet "is.
Her father was proud to be successful in his work and she described Paddington as "a very important member of the family".
"He was not an arrogant person and a very level-headed man," she said.
"He was almost as proud of Paddington as he was of a child when they achieved something, even though you didn't necessarily contribute because he was very real to him.
I think that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
He always let Paddington go first, even though it arose from his imagination and fantasy. "
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
At the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life after she was taken there after landing.
"It was really bad and not to be expected that she would make it, Nad reported regularly on the phone."
"In a phone call, Nad informed me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did
"Tashi, I love you so much honey," I said.
I'll come to you soon.
I will come to you.
The medication the doctors had given her to keep her heart beating slowly subsided and disappeared from her body.
Now everything has been closed after she died some time ago.
While I knew everything would open, I just had to sit and wait.
I was surrounded by families and people, so I couldn't cry, scream, or cry
I was forced to hold it together. "
Without knowing what kind of torment she would face, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had been mourning her daughter up to this point, went on board the plane with the other passengers.
"Nobody knew," she noted.
"I had my head bowed and tears were flowing all the time,
On the plane, I found Nad incredibly personable, but I find it difficult to explain.
He needed my understanding and my love.
"I knew how much he had taken to his heart"
Postcards from grieving women to prevent suicides on bridges.
After two women have lost loved ones to suicide, they work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
On a Welsh bridge, Kelly Humphreys and Sharon Davis leave cards with helpful, positive messages and pastoral phone numbers.
Tyler, son of Ms. Davis, who has been depressed since he was 13, committed suicide when he was 18.
She said, "The way I have to feel every day, I don't want other parents to feel."
Her son would be a cook with good prospects and an infectious smile, said 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Ledley.
"He was known to everyone for his smile."
His smile would light up any room, they always said.
Since he was "in very dire shape," he gave up his job before his death.
After he committed suicide in 2014, his then 11-year-old brother found him.
“One of the resulting chain reactions is what I worry about all the time,” said Ms. Davis.
"To show people that there are other people who can help you when you go to them, even if that's a friend," Ms. Davis made the cards.
"You have to talk to someone - don't just sit there alone."
Shortly after his mother passed away, Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies, lost her husband, with whom she had been in a partnership for 15 years.
"He didn't say that he was down or that he was depressed," she said.
"We noticed shortly before Christmas that his attitude had changed."
"It was at its absolute lowest point on Christmas Day - while the children opened their presents and he neither looked them in the eye nor did anything else."
"It's tearing the family apart from the inside," she said, as everyone was traumatized by his death, but somehow had to endure it.
It tears us apart.
We must all stand firm and keep looking forward.

With the FBI starting the investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy.
Mr Flake stated on Saturday that he thought if they could really get what he was looking for - a time and scope investigation - they might get a little cohesion, adding that he was concerned about the committee being over one Partial standstill could "break".
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to step in?
The hesitation is entirely due to timing.
If Republicans do as badly as expected before the midterm elections in five weeks' time on November 6th, it will be much more difficult for them to get their favorite candidate for the country's highest court.
Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked under George Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was then personal assistant to Mr. Bush, received support from the President by calling the Senate.
What happens once the FBI finishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to break a tie and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, a defector from North Korea quantified the drop.
A South Korean MP says the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un became head of state seven years ago.
There were 2,706 defectors in 2011, compared with 1,127 last year, reports Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the Unification Ministry.
According to Mr. Park, the causes are higher prices charged by the smugglers and stricter controls at the borders between North Korea and China.
There was no public statement from Pyongyang.
At some point, the vast majority of North Korean defectors will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border, Seoul says.
Easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states is the border with China, which has the longest border with North Korea and therefore most people flee this way.
China often forcibly sends defectors back home because they are seen more as illegal immigrants than as refugees.
In recent months, relations between the north and the south - officially still at war - have changed significantly for the better.
Nuclear disarmament was at the center of the negotiations for which the two heads of state met in Pyongyang earlier this month.
This happened after US President Donald Trump and Kim-Jong-un in Singapore in June, in a meeting going down in history, generously agreed to steer towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress.
Addressing the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ri said that there would be no trust in national security without trust in the US, and in such circumstances there would be no way to first get rid of the weapons.
According to Nancy Pelosi, Brett Kavanaugh is "hysterical" and unsuitable for a position on Surpreme Court.
According to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is "hysterical" and currently unable to serve on the Supreme Court.
These are the statements Pelosi made during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival on Saturday.
Speaking to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony that she couldn't help but think that she had called "hysterical" a woman who behaved in this way.
Kavanaugh strictly fought against the adolescent accusations of Dr. Having raped Christine Blasey Ford.
While Kavanaugh spoke about his family and his time in high school in his opening speech, he became very emotional, screamed at times, and his voice failed him.
As a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by the Liberals, who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016, he described the hostility to him against the Democrats in the committee.
Because his testimony shows that he was negative towards Democrats, Pelosi believes Kavanaugh is unfit to serve on Surpreme Court.
She said that he disqualified himself with the way he teased the Clintons and with those statements.
When asked if she would try to indict Kavanaugh if he were to get the office and if the Democrats were to outnumber the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
Pelosi said that if he were not honest with Congress or the FBI, he would not be eligible for either the Supreme Court or the court where he is currently at.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Considered a conservative judge, Pelosi, as a Democrat, would be concerned about possible Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, she added.
When asked if he would give more thought to specific decisions by the Surpreme Court, Kavanaugh replied evasively.
Pelosi said it was not time for a hysterical and partisan personality to go to court with the expectation that it would be perceived as "wonderful" by everyone.
Women must do this.
Without breaking into tears, she does not manage to hold the righteous diatribe, in which a great deal of pent-up anger comes out.
Ms. Steinem told me 45 years after the event that if you got angry you would cry.
"I don't think this is unusual, is it?"
“From a woman who was a manager somewhere, who couldn't hold back tears when she got angry, but used a method where she told people around that they might think they were sad just because they had to cry She got a lot of help, she continued.
I'm pissed off."
And then she just continued.
That was awesome, I thought. "
To be able to let out your anger because you were fundamentally misunderstood, tears are okay.
After an elderly lady, a cool manager, in whose presence I was always afraid, grabbed my collar and pulled me into a stairwell, I remember very clearly a situation from a previous job in which I was extremely angry and burst into tears , found in an office.
She told me never to cry in front of her.
They don't know that you're extremely angry.
Since it upsets them, they will be happy when they think you are sad.
Gary Hart was served by a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, Patricia Schroeder, during his presidential run.
There would be no reason to think about the idea of running for president yourself, thought the enormously frustrated Ms. Schroeder in 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on the Monkey Business, a ship, having a non-marital affair and thus for the presidency was no longer an option.
Thirty years later, she laughed and told me that it wasn't a very well thought out decision.
The last thing they needed was another candidate, out of seven that were already shortlisted.
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," someone called it.
She didn't want to join the race until she raised $ 2 million in donations, as the campaign was very advanced.
The fight was hopeless.
Some supporters only gave her a quarter of the money they gave the men she had to find out.
She wondered if they would believe she was getting a discount.
She was extremely overwhelmed by her feelings in her speech, in which she announced that she did not want to launch a formal campaign in public - gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it a challenge to receive money and Reaching MPs and voters and anger at sexism - that she was almost incomprehensible as she burst into tears as she spoke.
Ms. Schroeder remembered how the media had reacted to her, making them think she was nervous.
“Kleenex is the sponsor of my company, one might have guessed.
I remembered what they would write on my tombstone.
"Did she cry?"
How the US-China trade war can have a positive impact on Beijing
Experts say that the opening volleys in the trade war between China and the US were extremely loud and that while the end of the war is far from in sight, this dispute between the two parties can turn into a long-term benefit for Beijing.
Earlier this year, American President Donald Trump started the war by imposing tariffs on Chinese products such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
New tariffs meant a big escalation this week as $ 200 billion (£ 150 million) worth of items, effectively 50% of products imported into the US from China, were taxed.
Beijing resisted in the same way by adding five to ten percent tariffs to American goods worth $ 60 billion.
China stressed that it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy would give way in the near future and that it would slowly be on a par with the USA.
For China's President Xi Jinping, it would be embarrassing to back down to the US in public and to induce Washington to give in would mean lowering the requirements.
Experts believe that the pressures on China could possibly have a positive long-term effect if Beijing could play out its advantages cleverly and by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
Abigail Grace, a research fellow and expert on Asia at the “Center for New American Security” think tank, emphasized that it was much more dangerous than it was previously clear to external parties that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could cause financial problems to start .
The Syrian Foreign Minister stressed that they were prepared for the return of the refugees.
In order to rebuild the city, which was ruined after more than seven years of war, they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and pray for help, said Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim said in an address to the General Assembly of the United Nations that the conditions in his country are changing for the better.
He said that the situation on the ground is more stable and secure at this point in time due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
To get back to normal, the government is continuing to restore the areas destroyed by terrorism.
In the meantime, all requirements for a voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that had a negative impact on their everyday lives and livelihoods have been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country depend on human support.
The Syrian regime would look forward to support in rebuilding the destroyed country, said Al-Muallim.
He would not accept support from countries that had contributed economically to the uprising or countries that made their aid subject to conditions.

I am very grateful to Thomas for motivating me and not losing faith in me.
Getting the cup back makes me happy.
A touched Garcia said after the European victory that it was about the team and that he was glad he could help.
He gave the floor to John Ram, his compatriot, who was able to inflict a 2 to 1 defeat on Tiger Woods, a US golf legend, in singles play on Sunday.
23-year-old Rahm said he was very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom he watched growing up.
After losing all of his four games in France, Woods has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.

Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau played golf at the highest level throughout the tournament, while the rest of their team (USA) struggled to find the fairways.
“They fought, the boys make me proud,” said the captain of the American team, Jim Furyk, after a disappointing team performance.
When we put pressure on the Europeans there was some time this morning.
We gave up.
Strong performance from Thomas.
He is a fantastic captain.
All 12 of his players made a very strong game.
I'm working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee to reposition ourselves and move on.
It makes me proud to be the captain of these 12 guys that I love very much.
You should touch her cap.
We were played out. "
